When charging at maximum 32A the temperature rises to 55°C throughout the charging circuit (40A Legrand circuit breaker/differential/cable/charging connector).\n\nAt 26A the temperature recorded is 39°C\n\nBut now I no longer have confidence in this Legrand connection method, at least for vehicle charging. So what can I do to monitor this type of risk and avoid a fire in the home, especially when the home is all electric and I charge the vehicle most of the time at night.\n\nFirstly I installed a Zigbee fire siren near the electrical panel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n FRIENT - ZIGBEE 3.0 INTELLIGENT SMOKE DETECTOR (DIN EN 14604 AND DIN 14676) + SIREN FUNCTION\n By Frient\n The FRIENT intelligent smoke detector can alert you remotely and in real time in the event of a fire in your home.\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now\n \n \n\n\n\nIn addition to the 40A differential/circuit breaker, I added a zigbee smart switch with many functions, the Tongou TO-Q-SY2-JZT.\n\n\n At this point you say to yourself, he doesn’t have confidence in Legrand and he is adding a Chinese brand to the circuit!\n\n\nIndeed you are not wrong, to respect I first looked at the big brands but I did not find a 40A circuit breaker that measures heat. So I turned to Aliexpress and I saw this switch TO-Q-SY2-JZT which works under Zigbee and Tuya protocol. To reassure myself I did some research on the Internet and the Tongou TO-Q-SY2-JZT is manufactured by the company ELCB, it has been manufacturing electrical equipment for 30 years and works among others with brands (Thyssenkrupp, Haski, STD, HL, Vistar…).\n\nReminder\n\n \n \n \n \n Warning\n You will have to work near a voltage of 220V which is dangerous if you come into contact with an electrical conductor. Take care in your handling, if in doubt cut off the power supply.\n \n\n\nA differential is there to protect people in the event of current leaks greater than 30ma\nA circuit breaker protects the equipment against overcurrent or short circuit\n\nPresentation of Tongou TO-Q-SY2-JZT\n\nTo start as I have read here and there and in certain product titles:\n\n this module is not a circuit breaker but a switch, it must be connected in addition to it, because it does not act as a circuit breaker.\n\n\nThe TO-Q-SY2-JZT has some exceptional features. To begin with, the quality is very good at least on the visual aspect, I did not open it. The characteristics of the module are numerous, the most interesting concerns the adjustment of the configurable amperage between 1 and 63A.\nThe instructions provided with the module are very well written you can download it a little further down.\n\n\n\nThe black front of the module displays the module information:\n\n maximum amperage from 1 to 63A adjustable via the official app or your assistant\n The Zigbee network connection indicator (solid blue) when connected\n The physical switch the central indicator turns red\n\n\n\n\nComparison with a Legrand NF circuit breaker\n\nFrom the front the modules look similar in size and that’s a good thing, the most shocking appearance and the black color of the switch, but that has little importance in my eyes.\n\n\n\nYou will see that the Tongou TO-Q-SY2-JZT displays all the CE standards on the module and the company complies with ISO9001 standards\n\n\n\nIt is at the level of the terminal blocks that we will notice a difference between the difference between the neutral and the phase compared to the NF standards, which could pose a problem in theory if you use combs in connection. But for the Tongou TO-Q-SY2-JZT it doesn’t matter, since it is connected in addition to a circuit breaker at its outlet. Below is a capture of the connection at the electrical panel (I used 3G10 for EV charging)\n\n\n\nWhat is the interest of Tongou TO-Q-SY2-JZT\n\nFor me the interest is to measure the temperature inside the components and to automate a cut-off depending on possible overheating. And the Tongou TO-Q-SY2-JZT measures the temperature 👍.\n\n\n And maybe lower the system charging temperature who knows…\n\n\nCharacteristic of TO-Q-SY2-JZT\n\nThe Tongou TO-Q-SY2-JZT smart switch protects:\n\n\n the circuit against overloads\n the circuit against overvoltages\n the circuit against voltages\n the circuit against overcurrents\n the circuit against high temperatures\n\n\nControl by home automation\n\nAnd this is where the module is very interesting, it concerns the number of functionalities that can be configured and controlled remotely using your favorite assistant.\n\nYou will be able to use ZHA, Zigbee2mqtt, Tuya and smartlife:\n\n\n control the ignition\n memory in case of power failure\n Set the operation switch lighting mode\n measure instantaneous power\n Measure Instantaneous Amperage\n display the cumulative energy in the dashboard (home assistant)\n internal temperature\n cut-off in the event of high temperature as well as the threshold for this temperature\n cut-off in the event of overloads as well as the overload threshold\n cut-off in the event of overcurrent as well as the amperage threshold\n cutoff in the event of an overvoltage as well as the threshold\n cutoff in the event of undervoltage as well as the threshold\n the quality of the zigbee link (Z2M and Tuya)\n\n\n\n So this is very impressive, especially since I bought this switch for €15 and it has a 2-year warranty.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nIntegration into Zigbee2mqtt\n\nIn this article I only covered the integration in Zigbee2mqtt to avoid overloading the writing. In short, at least you will be able to see how much information can be used thanks to Z2M.\n\nTo begin with, the inclusion is simple, fast and stable. The switch is well recognized as a router.\n\n\n\nIn terms of order exhibitions, I know the list is long, nothing better than an image to list them.\n\n\n I reversed the physical button indicator\n\n\nturns off the module in the event of:\n\n\n temperature above 60°C\n if the power is greater than 8kw\n if the amperage is greater than 33A\n if the voltage is lower than 215 or higher than 245V\n\n\n\n\nWhat could have been improved\n\nAside from the part of the hardware visual which could have been more compliant with the Legrand/Hager standards, what bothers me the most is the lighting of the Zigbee connectivity display LED.\n\nAfter inclusion in your favorite system, the LED remains blue and quite intense. Management could have been less conspicuous, for example at Legrand Netatmo.\nThe light is:\n\n red when the module is off-grid\n green when the module is integrated\n turns off after full integration of the module\n turns green again when you put your system in inclusion mode\n\n\nBut hey, such a module costs between 55 and 80€\n\nSecond thing that could have been improved is the addition of inputs to configure your remote control type lighting system\n\n\n Finally the Tongou TO-Q-SY2-JZT could have been a circuit breaker and not a switch in order to avoid module overload in the electrical panel\n\n\nTemperature measurement\n\n\n \n \n \n \n Tongou smart circuit breaker\n By Tongou\n Tuya MCB Smart Circuit Breaker, Power Metering, Smart Switch, Overcurrent and Undervoltage Protection, WiFi, Zigbee, 1-63A, Overheat Protection\n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Aliexpress\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nConnection without circuit breaker\n\nTo carry out this test while taking the temperature, I connected the differential and directly the TO-Q-SY2-JZT switch, leaving a space between the two.\nDuring a vehicle charging phase at 32A, the Tongou TO-Q-SY2-JZT goes from 20°C to 37°C maximum as shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\nConnection with circuit breaker\n\nThen I connected the circuit breaker in addition to the differential and the switch all attached in the electrical panel (as a reminder the temperature measured on the Legrand circuit breaker connected without the Tongou was 55°C {: .red} in full charge)\nDuring a vehicle charging phase at 32A the temperature goes from 22 to 46°C as shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\nRecap\n\n\n differential + circuit breaker 55°C\n differential + tongou switch 37°C\n differential + circuit breaker + switch 46°C\n\n\nTongou Documents TO-Q-SY2-JZT\n\nTongou TO-Q-SY2-JZT Circuit Breaker User Manual\n\nCE EMC certification Tongou circuit breaker TO-Q-SY2-JZT\n\nCE certification RED LVD Tongou circuit breaker TO-Q-SY2-JZT\n\nTechnical characteristics TO-Q-SY2-JZT\n\n\n \n \n Product or component type\n TO-Q-SY2-JZT\n \n \n Application\n Smart Life, Smart Electric, Tuya\n \n \n Third party support\n Home Assistant, Zigbee2MQTT\n \n \n Poles description\n 1P+N (Direct N Pole)\n \n \n Function\n Timing, Countdown, Loop timing, Metering, Over Current, Under Voltage, Over Voltage, Over Power, High Temperature Protection.\n \n \n Rated Current (In)\n 1 – 63A\n \n \n Operating voltage Range\n AC 90V – 280V\n \n \n Rated Frequency\n 50Hz/60Hz\n \n \n Control Type\n Remote, Manual\n \n \n Communication Protocol\n Zigbee 3.0\n \n \n Operating system support\n Android, iOS, HarmonyOS\n \n \n Gateway\tZigbee\n (Wireless / Wired)\n \n \n Operating Language\n With system language\n \n \n App Language\n Follow the operating system language\n \n \n Voice Support\n Amazon Alexa, Yandex Alice, Google Assistant..\n \n \n\n\nproduct advantages TO-Q-SY2-JZT\n\n\n the price around 16€\n zigbee 3.0 compatible\n Zigbee2mqtt compatible (Home Assistant, Gladys, Jeedom)\n ZHA compatible\n Tuya/Smartlife compatible\n does not overheat\n Google Assistant\n Amazon Alexa\n Very Many functions\n IEC 60947-1 standards\n 2 years warranty\n\n\nthe - of the product TO-Q-SY2-JZT\n\n\n does not perform the role of short circuit\n is not considered a circuit breaker but a switch\n management of the Zigbee connectivity LED cannot be configured\n does not act as a remote control switch\n upstream must be connected a differential and a dedicated circuit breaker per circuit.\n\n\nNext step: home automation of the ve-tronic Wallbox\n\nThe Wallbox is 5 years old and it is not by default automated, but I have the possibility of doing it in RS232 and I am going to work on it so I could control the switching on or off, but also modify the amperage, so in the event of overheating instead of cutting the power to the Wallbox I will only have to ask to lower the amperage and it will be great.\n\nRecently C4Software released a directory to be able to homemate the ce-tronic Wallbox with RS232 and esp8266, it can be consulted here\n\nBig rant\n\nWe are constantly told that Legrand is quality, according to some it is the top NF, but here I can only explode, nothing but the totally insane price plus these circuit breakers are not even capable of maintaining a decent temperature while a Chinese module does better.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n Tongou smart circuit breaker\n By Tongou\n Tuya MCB Smart Circuit Breaker, Power Metering, Smart Switch, Overcurrent and Undervoltage Protection, WiFi, Zigbee, 1-63A, Overheat Protection\n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Aliexpress\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nConclusion\n\nIf, like me, you charge at a terminal dedicated to your electric vehicle, I strongly advise you to monitor the heat of the panel components. Given the price of Legrand modules, the heating is considerable and in my opinion this is an unacceptable part. Connecting an additional switch to the circuit will allow you to control the switching off of the load in the event of overheating but also to measure consumption on a separate circuit.\nConcerning the Tongou switch TO-Q-SY2-JZT I can only recommend it to you, you can add more to control the sockets, lighting, water heater etc… and that for a price more than correct. Currently it is the Tuya module which provides the most information in Zigbee2mqtt.\n\n", "datePublished": "2024-01-06 10:13:00 +0100", "dateModified": "2024-01-06 10:13:00 +0100", "inLanguage":

breaker burned following overheating" /></picture><p><strong>And yet this month of October 2023</strong> the Legrand brand 40A circuit breaker burned taking away the differential and fortunately a trip at the main meter took place, the fire did not spread into the electrical panel.</p><blockquote><p>So what happened and how to fix it.</p></blockquote><p>To begin with I replaced what burned <strong>(type A differential/C curve circuit breaker)</strong>, I lowered the maximum load amperage on the wallbox. If I lowered the charging amperage it is to avoid heat at the circuit breaker because I think that overheating is the cause of this anomaly.</p><p>before domotizing the charging system I measured the temperature during prolonged charging. <strong>When charging at maximum 32A the temperature rises to 55°C</strong> throughout the charging circuit (40A Legrand circuit breaker/differential/cable/charging connector).</p><p><strong>At 26A the temperature recorded is 39°C</strong></p><p>But now I no longer have confidence in this <strong>Legrand</strong> connection method, at least for vehicle charging. So what can I do to monitor this type of risk and avoid a fire in the home, especially when the home is all electric and I charge the vehicle most of the time at night.</p><p>Firstly I installed a Zigbee fire siren near the electrical panel.</p><div class="embedproduct"><div class="embedproduct-picture"><picture> <source sizes="(max-width: 480px) 250px, (max-width: 768px) 350px, (max-width: 1024px) 400px, (min-width: 1025px) 30vw, calc(100vw - 30px)" srcset="https://haade.fr/assets/images/generated/shop/2175/frient-detecteur-de-fumee-intelligent-zigbee-30-250-954a1534a.webp 250w, https://haade.fr/assets/images/generated/shop/2175/frient-detecteur-de-fumee-intelligent-zigbee-30-350-954a1534a.webp 350w, https://haade.fr/assets/images/generated/shop/2175/frient-detecteur-de-fumee-intelligent-zigbee-30-400-954a1534a.webp 400w, https://haade.fr/assets/images/generated/shop/2175/frient-detecteur-de-fumee-intelligent-zigbee-30-444-954a1534a.webp 444w" type="image/webp" /> <source sizes="(max-width: 480px) 250px, (max-width: 768px) 350px, (max-width: 1024px) 400px, (min-width: 1025px) 30vw, calc(100vw - 30px)" srcset="https://haade.fr/assets/images/generated/shop/2175/frient-detecteur-de-fumee-intelligent-zigbee-30-250-954a1534a.jpg 250w, https://haade.fr/assets/images/generated/shop/2175/frient-detecteur-de-fumee-intelligent-zigbee-30-350-954a1534a.jpg 350w, https://haade.fr/assets/images/generated/shop/2175/frient-detecteur-de-fumee-intelligent-zigbee-30-400-954a1534a.jpg 400w, https://haade.fr/assets/images/generated/shop/2175/frient-detecteur-de-fumee-intelligent-zigbee-30-444-954a1534a.jpg 444w" type="image/jpeg" /> <img class="lazyload" width="250" height="250" src="https://haade.fr/assets/images/generated/shop/2175/frient-detecteur-de-fumee-intelligent-zigbee-30-400-954a1534a.jpg" alt="The FRIENT intelligent smoke detector can alert you remotely and in real time in the event of a fire in your home." /> </picture></div><div class="text"><div class="embedproduct-info"><h2 class="no_toc">FRIENT - ZIGBEE 3.0 INTELLIGENT SMOKE DETECTOR (DIN EN 14604 AND DIN 14676) + SIREN FUNCTION</h2><h3 class="no_toc">By Frient</h3><p>The FRIENT intelligent smoke detector can alert you remotely and in real time in the event of a fire in your home.</p></div><div class="embedproduct-price"><div class="embedaffiliate"> <span class="haadebutton" role="button"><a href="/en/product/fire-detector-frient-smszb-120">Buy Now</a></span></div></div></div></div><p>In addition to the 40A differential/circuit breaker, I added a zigbee smart switch with many functions, the Tongou TO-Q-SY2-JZT.</p><blockquote><p>At this point you say to yourself, he doesn’t have confidence in Legrand and he is adding a Chinese brand to the circuit!</p></blockquote><p>Indeed you are not wrong, to respect I first looked at the big brands but <strong>I did not find a 40A circuit breaker that measures heat.</strong> So I turned to Aliexpress and I saw this switch TO-Q-SY2-JZT which works under Zigbee and Tuya protocol.

overheating instead of cutting the power to the Wallbox I will only have to ask to lower the amperage and it will be great.</p><p>Recently <strong>C4Software</strong> released a directory to be able

of the panel components. Given the price of Legrand modules, the heating is considerable and in my opinion this is an unacceptable part. Connecting an additional switch to the circuit will allow you to control the switching off of the load in the event of overheating but also to measure consumption on a separate circuit. Concerning <strong>the Tongou switch TO-Q-SY2-JZT I can only recommend it to you</strong>, you can add more to control the sockets, lighting, water heater etc… and that for a price more than correct. <em>Currently it is the Tuya module which provides the most information in Zigbee2mqtt.</em></p></div></div><div class="sourcelink"> <span class="titlesource">Source posts</span><ol><li class="contentlink"> <a rel="canonical" href="https://fr.elcb.net/Les-produits/disjoncteur-intelligent-zigbee-protection-contre-les-surintensit%C3%A9s-sous-tension-%C3%A0-q-sy2-jzt/" target="_blank">fr.elcb.net</a><i class="icos external-link-alt-solid"></i><li class="contentlink"> <a rel="canonical" href="https://forum.hacf.fr/t/disjoncteur-en-zigbee-vos-retours/28150/11" target="_blank">forum.hacf.fr</a><i class="icos external-link-alt-solid"></i><li class="contentlink"> <a rel="canonical" href="https://hackaday.com/2021/04/18/diy-wireless-serial-adapter-speaks-true-rs-232/" target="_blank">hackaday.com</a><i class="icos external-link-alt-solid"></i></ol></div><div class="rating mt-4 mb-4 d-flex align-items-center"> <strong class="mr-1">Rating:</strong><div class="rating-holder"><div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4.4;
