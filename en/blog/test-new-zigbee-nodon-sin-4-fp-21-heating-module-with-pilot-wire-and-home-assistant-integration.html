But the integration into Home Assistant with management by thermostat is natively impossible. Why? quite simply because it does not include on/off switches which is essential for the integration of generic thermostats. Don’t worry, I’ll fix it almost transparently\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n NODON ZIGBEE 3.0 PILOT WIRE SIN-4-FP-21\n By Nodon\n Dedicated to pilot wire electric radiators, the Zigbee 3.0 Pilot Wire Heating Module allows them to be connected and automate heating management to save energy.\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now\n \n \n\n\n\nThere is a youtube video edited by Zatoufly which explains to you how to integrate the pilot wire node into home-assistant and control it with the generic thermostat by creating a virtual switch and a call by automation by creating a scenario.\n\n\n That’s good but I’m going to present you with a different approach where you won’t need to create a scenario.\n\n\nPresentation of NodOn SIN-4-FP-21\n\nDedicated to pilot wire electric radiators, the Zigbee Pilot Wire Heating Module allows them to be connected and automate heating management to save energy. It allows you to manage up to six modes and at least: Comfort, Eco, Frost Protection and Off. Paired with a compatible home automation system, heating management becomes intelligent and automatic.\n\n\n\navailable functions SIN-4-FP-21\n\nThe Pilot Wire Heating Module has 6 modes: Comfort, Comfort -1°C, Comfort -2°C, Eco, Frost Protection and Off allowing local or automatic control.\n\n\n Consumption measurement\n Instantaneous power and cumulative energy measurement functions, to save energy\n Installation without work\n At the cable outlet of the electric radiator pilot wire\n Over The Air Update (OTA)\n\n\nThe module is quick to update thanks to the OTA function. Updates can be carried out via a compatible home automation center or via the [NodOn Connect] application.(https://nodon.fr/nodon/application-nodon-connect/){: target=”_blank”}\n\nNotices SIN-4-FP-21\n\nNodOn pilot wire SIN-4-FP-21 data sheet\n\nUser manual NodOn pilot wire SIN-4-FP-21\n\nConnection diagram SIN-4-FP-21\n\n\n Simpler, you die!\n\n\n\n\nPanel connection diagram\n\nAdd the Zigbee Driver Wire Heating Module to the electrical panel with the NodOn DIN Rail Box*.\n\n\n\nTechnical characteristics SIN-4-FP-21\n\n\n \n \n Power supply\n 230V AC ~ 50Hz\n \n \n Consumption\n &lt;1W\n \n \n Maximum power. heater\n 3680W\n \n \n Counting instantaneous power\n (W) and cumulative energy\n \n \n (Wh)\n  \n \n \n Modes\n 6 orders Pilot Wire\n \n \n Radio protocol\n Zigbee 3.0\n \n \n Frequency band used\n 2.4Ghz\n \n \n Maximum radio power\n +10dBm\n \n \n Range\n up to 40m indoors\n \n \n Operating temperature\n • Between -20 and 40° in the open air.• Between -20 and 35°C in a recessed box.• Between -20 and 40°C in the NodOn DRB (DIN Rail Box).• Between -20 and 40°C in the NodOn BPS (Surface Mounting Box).\n \n \n Protection index\n IP 20\n \n \n\n\nLegrand 064882 pilot wire\n\nThe only pilot wire module currently competing with NodOn, Legrand stands out by its 100% functional integration but also adds switch functions which makes it fully natively compatible with home-assistant via Zigbee2mqtt integration .\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Legrand 064882 zigbee module radiator driver wire\n By Legrand\n Céliane Connected Cable Outlet - 230V - Pilot Wire Compatible - For Radiators and Electrical Appliances Up to 3000W - Made in France\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Amazon\n \n \n \n\n\nZigbee2mqtt integration\n\n\n\nNodon integration SIN-4-FP-21\n\nZHA (Home Assistant)\n\nCurrently the NodOn module SIN-4-FP-21 is incompatible with ZHA, information comes up but does not correspond to this module, it is recognized as the NodOn SIN-4-1-20 multifunction module, which does not does not make it a native wire-driver module.\n\n\n\nZigbee2mqtt\n\nIntegration into Z2M is 200% functional everything is supported\n\n\n\nYou can see the main functions in the tab:\n\n\n Power\n Energy (compatible with the Home Assistant energy tab)\n 6 modes\n link quality\n\n\n\n\nPower and energy can be fine-tuned and calibrated using additional settings.\n\n\n\nTo finish displaying the functions reported in Home Assistant in mqtt.\n\n\n\nPairing\n\nNodOn official technical information SIN-4-FP-21\n\nWhen powered on, the module’s LED flashes orange seeking to join a Zigbee network. Go to the application of your Zigbee control unit to activate module detection.\n\n\n\nIf the module has successfully joined the network, the LED turns green. The module is ready to use.\n\n\n\nIf the module has not joined a network within 15 minutes, the LED turns orange. Quickly press the module button and start the procedure again.\n\n\n\nProcedure for resetting SIN-4-FP-21\n\n\n The module must be connected and powered on.\n Press the module button for more than 5 seconds. The LED flashes orange.\n Press the button again (short press), to validate the reset. If the reset takes place\ncorrectly, the LED flashes alternately in red and green, then flashes in orange. Repeat if necessary.\n Your module has returned to its original configuration and is ready to join a new Zigbee network.\n\n\nHome assistant integration\n\nI chose the integration by zigbee2mqtt because the Nodon SIN-4-FP-21 is well recognized and as you already know Z2M is compatible with various boxes like Jeedom, Openhab and Gladys to name a few . Find information on the integration of the module in Z2M directly on the official link\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nIn order to create the two files below and modify the configuration.yaml file you will need to install one of the two additional applications presented below, **personally if you are new to home-assistant I recommend file-editor **, to install it directly in your instance simply click on the link.\n\n\n File Editor\n Visual Studio Code\n\n\n\n Also you will need to include the NodOn module SIN-4-FP-21 in HA before creating these scripts.\n\n\nswitch.yaml\n\nWe will start to create a switch.yaml file which will group together all your virtual switches because yes you could have several like a switch which would start your PC for example…. So go to the root /config and creates a file named switch.yaml.\n\ncreating a switch in home assistant.\n\nCopy the lines of code below without forgetting to fill in the correct lines.\n\n- platform: template\n switches:\n # Switch entity name in HA\n inter_radiateur_salon:\n # Inter name in HA\n friendly_name: &quot;Inter Radiateur salon&quot;\n # Unique Name\n unique_id: inter_radiateur_salon\n # replace select.radiateur_salon_pilot_wire_mode with your integrated module\n value_template: &quot;{{ is_state(&#39;select.radiateur_salon_pilot_wire_mode&#39;, &#39;comfort&#39;) }}&quot;\n turn_on:\n service: select.select_option\n data:\n option: comfort\n target:\n entity_id: \n # replace select.radiateur_salon_pilot_wire_mode with your integrated module\n - select.radiateur_salon_pilot_wire_mode\n turn_off:\n service: select.select_option\n data:\n option: &quot;off&quot;\n target:\n entity_id: \n # replace select.radiateur_salon_pilot_wire_mode with your integrated module\n - select.radiateur_salon_pilot_wire_mode\n\nin this switch we directly automate the functions of the nodon module SIN-4-FP-21 by the input select.radiateur_salon_pilot_wire_mode and we indicate, when the switch is activated, it selects the comfort mode and deactivates the off mode of the module so no need for a scenario.\n\n\n For the moment it is not possible to enter these options by creating a virtual switch via the interface directly in ha.\n\n\nthermostat.yaml\n\nNow that the switch is created, repeat the same procedure to create a generic thermostat named thermostat.yaml.\n\nCreating a generic thermostat thermostat.yaml\n\nTo configure a generic thermostat in Home Assistant you will also need an external temperature sensor, I recommend for example the Sonoff SNZB-02P module, you can at the same time read the review article of this one\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n SONOFF - ZIGBEE 3.0 TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY SENSOR WITH BRACKET - SNZB-02P\n By Sonoff\n The SONOFF SNZB-02P temperature and humidity sensor informs you of the temperature and humidity.\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now\n \n \n\n\n\n# nodon module living room\n- platform: generic_thermostat\n # Name of our thermostat\n name: Living Room Heating\n # unique identity\n unique_id: thermostat_chauffage_salon\n # inter heating entity previously created\n heater: switch.inter_radiateur_salon\n # room temperature sensor entity (required)\n target_sensor: sensor.thermostat_salon_temperature\n # the minimum adjustable temperature of the thermostat\n min_temp: 16\n # the maximum adjustable temperature of the thermostat generally corresponds to the setpoint temperature set on the radiator in pilot wire mode\n max_temp: 23\n # operating mode of the “heater” system\n ac_mode: false\n # the default target temperature\n target_temp: 21\n # this is the low temperature tolerance for heating activation\n cold_tolerance: 0.5\n # temperature tolerance before heating is activated\n hot_tolerance: 0.5\n # this is the mode in which the thermostat first starts\n initial_hvac_mode: &quot;off&quot;\n # temperature in case of absent mode\n away_temp: 12\n # This is the precision for temperature setting\n accuracy: 0.5\n # the minimum time of an operating cycle\n min_cycle_duration:\n seconds: 5\n # keeps heating for at least 3 minutes if the thermostat does not receive a command\n keep_alive:\n minutes: 3\n\nconfiguration.yaml\n\nLast step creates a direction link to the two files previously created in the Home-Assistant configuration.yaml file. after the following lines:\n\ngroup: !include groups.yaml\nautomation: !include automations.yaml\nscript: !include scripts.yaml\nscene: !include scenes.yaml\n\nWhich gives the result:\n\ngroup: !include groups.yaml\nautomation: !include automations.yaml\nscript: !include scripts.yaml\nscene: !include scenes.yaml\nswitch: !include switch.yaml\nclimate: !include thermostat.yaml\n\nNow all you have to do is restart home assistant to discover the new entities created previously:\nthe switch switch.inter_radiateur_salon and the thermostat climate.thermostat_chauffage_salon.\n\n\n You will now be able to control your radiators with the thermostat function.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n NODON ZIGBEE 3.0 PILOT WIRE SIN-4-FP-21\n By Nodon\n Dedicated to pilot wire electric radiators, the Zigbee 3.0 Pilot Wire Heating Module allows them to be connected and automate heating management to save energy.\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now\n \n \n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nOf exemplary quality this pilot wire module signed NodOn SIN-4-FP-21 does the job, it lacks the switch function which would allow it to be simply turned off, and mandatory to be able to control it in Home Assistant by the Thermostat card. But with a few lines of code you can make the whole thing functional and transparent to use. To finish the Legrand 064882 pilot wire allows you to do all this natively but you will have to put your hand in your wallet because it is 10€ more expensive, if you are no longer ready for that I I recommend the Legrand, otherwise the NodOn will do the trick and what’s more you could integrate it directly into your electrical panel.\n", "datePublished": "2024-04-08 17:00:00 +0200", "dateModified": "2024-04-08 17:00:00 +0200", "inLanguage": "en-GB", "author": { "@type": "Person", "name": "Nico", "alternateName": "Nico", "description": "Founding member of the Haade website, I have been passionate about home automation, computers and electronics for over 10 years.

But <strong>with a few lines of code</strong> you can make <strong>the whole thing functional and transparent to use</strong>. To finish the <strong>Legrand 064882 pilot wire</strong> allows you to do all this natively but you will have to put <strong>your hand in your wallet because it is 10€ more expensive</strong>, if you are no longer ready for that <strong>I I recommend the Legrand</strong>, otherwise the NodOn will do the trick and what’s more you could integrate it directly into your electrical panel.</p></div></div><div class="sourcelink"> <span class="titlesource">Source posts</span><ol><li class="contentlink"> <a rel="canonical" href="https://nodon.fr/nodon/module-chauffage-fil-pilote-zigbee/" target="_blank">nodon.fr</a><i class="icos external-link-alt-solid"></i></ol></div><div class="rating mt-4 mb-4 d-flex align-items-center"> <strong class="mr-1">Rating:</strong><div class="rating-holder"><div class="Stars" style="--rating: 4.0; --star-background: #FF6600" title="Rating of this product is 4.0 out of 5."></div></div></div><div class="authorbox mb-5 mt-5 pt-4 pb-4" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="row"><div class="wrapavname col-md-3 text-center"><picture> <source srcset="https://haade.fr/assets/images/generated/nico-110-5d88b8595.webp 1.0x" type="image/webp"> <source srcset="https://haade.fr/assets/images/generated/nico-110-c8508425c.png 1.0x" type="image/png"> <img class="author-thumb" itemprop="image" width="110" height="110" src="https://haade.fr/assets/images/generated/nico-110-c8508425c.png" alt="Nico"> </picture><p class="mt-4 mb-0 small text-center"> <a target="_blank" class="d-inline-block mx-1 text-dark" itemprop="url" href="/fr/auteur-nico/"><i class="ico link-solid"></i></a> <a target="_blank" class="d-inline-block mx-1 text-dark" itemprop="sameAs" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcXJ1ZsjEvQxuWJy7gH-A6w"><i class="icob youtube"></i></a> <a target="_blank" class="d-inline-block mx-1 text-dark" itemprop="sameAs" href="https://github.com/haade-administrator"><i class="icob github"></i></a> <a target="_blank" class="d-inline-block mx-1 text-dark" itemprop="sameAs" href="https://discordapp.com/widget?id=637642871738073091&theme=dark&username=Nicoxygen#5644"><i class="icob discord"></i></a> <a class="d-inline-block mx-1 text-dark" itemprop="email" href="mailto:nico@haade.fr"><i class="ico envelope-solid"></i></a></p></div><div class="col-md-9"><h4 itemprop="name">Nico</h4><p class="mt-3 mb-0" itemprop="description">Founding member of the Haade website, I have been passionate about home automation, computers and electronics for over 10 years.
