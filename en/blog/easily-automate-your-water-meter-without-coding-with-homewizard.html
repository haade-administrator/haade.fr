It is a product that works in wifi and that records the water consumption thanks to a magnetic receiver. It is not a big novelty especially since Pieter Brinckman has already made a Diy module based on esp32 which will cost you less.\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Watermeter HWE-WTR-23\n By Homewizard\n Instantaneous water consumption measurement, Wi-Fi connection, adaptable to water meters on the European market and all compatible with Home Assistant\n \n \n 49.95€\n \n Buy Now\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n Info\n Haade.fr is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\n \n\n\n\n Super strong Homewizard HWE-WTR-23 packaging.\n\n\n\n\nUnpacking\n\nThe packaging is very well done, the outer carton is resistant in short you will not encounter any problems during delivery. Inside we will find a set of:\n\n\n screws\n 3 adapters for different brands of meters\n an installation guide especially on meters\n a usb-c socket\n ​​a 3 meter usb cable\n and of course a reading module HWE-WTR-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood to know\n\n\n On mains the Homewizardd watermeter HWE-WTR-23 reads data instantly.\n On Battery The Homewizard watermeter module HWE-WTR-23 reads data 4 times a day.\n\n\nHeld in the hand, so you can see the dimensions of the module, and you will find an access hatch for the connection by 123A batteries\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Amazon Basics CR123A\n By Amazon\n CR123A lithium batteries ideal for home automation devices and photos\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Amazon\n \n \n \n\n\nBelow are some pictures of the HWE-WTR-23 to give you an idea of ​​the product, it remains basic and does the essentials.\n\n\n I would like to congratulate Homewizard for providing a 4 meter long USB-C cable.\n\n\n\n\nThe Homewizard watermeter HWE-WTR-23 costs a little less than €50 but it is compatible with all European meters thanks to the adapters provided with it and that is a real plus.\n\n\n\nInstallation of the Homewizard HWE-WTR-23\n\nHomewizard HWE-WTR-23 and Remote Reading\n\n \n \n \n \n Warning\n First of all I would like to point out that my water meter is equipped with a telemeter which prevents the installation of such a module. For the sake of the test I removed the itron Everblu Cyble transmitter.\n \n\n\nWell I won’t hide it from you, this type of product has a big drawback, it can only be installed on a meter without a pulse transmitter. Yes, pulse meters are installed and work with magnetic transmitters/receivers.\n\n\n If you wish, you can easily remove the pulse meter; for me it’s an itron.\n\n\nOn the other hand, this one reads continuously, removing it and turning the water meter will create a difference, and the day the water company changes the pulse transmitter, they will take a manual reading of the meter and the bill could be steep.\n\n\n\nSome time ago, I wrote a procedure to measure water consumption on an Itron everblu cyble transmitter, using a 433mHz receiver, good reading.\n\nDomotize the Itron water meter with esp and cc1101 in ha for 10€\n\nSetting up the HWE-WTR-23\n\nThere again nothing more to say, the installation was carried out without any problems, just follow the instructions.\n\n\n\n\n Finally, you just have to clip the module onto the adapter and that’s it.\n\n\n\n\n\n From there, all you have to do is connect the HWE-WTR-23 to your home’s Wi-Fi network and calibrate the whole thing\n\n\nWhich meters are compatible\n\nThe list is long and that’s great, find the maximum amount of information below.\n\n\n Zenner\n Sensus\n Itron\n Actaris,\n Hidroconta\n Schlumberger\n Elster\n Honeywell\n Maddalena MVM\n DH Metering and Diehl Metering in 2 minutes. Just insert the water meter into the adapter, connect it to Wi-Fi and that’s it.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n ZennerZenner water meters are compatible. Simply attach bracket 2 and two screws (PS4/16).\n \n \n \n Sensus (1)There are two separate Sensus meters with different mountings. Check the Sensus meter you have carefully to ensure that the bracket is properly secured.Sensus (1) water meters are compatible and are secured using bracket 2 and two screws (PS2.6/8).\n \n \n \n Sensus (2)Check the Sensus meter in your possession carefully, so that you can fix the bracket properly.The Sensus (2) water meters are compatible and are fixed using bracket 1 and two screws (PS2.6/8). If the cover of this Sensus water meter is in the way when installing the bracket, you can turn the inside of the water meter (it is separate from the outer casing).\n \n \n \n Itron, Actaris, Hidroconta and SchlumbergerMost meters have a cap on the tip of the screw that can be broken off. Refer to the image for an example of the three different caps. This water meter can also be black or blue. Itron, Actaris, Hidroconta and Schlumberger water meters are compatible and are secured using bracket 1 and a screw (M4/12).\n \n \n \n Itron, Actaris, Hidroconta et Schlumberger\n \n \n \n Elsther, HoneywellElster and Honeywell water meters are compatible and are fixed using bracket 1 and two screws (PS4/16).\n \n \n \n Diehl MeteringDiehl Metering water meters do not have screw holes, instead you can snap the bracket 3 into the water meter.\n \n \n \n Dh MeteringDH Metering water meters are compatible and are fixed using bracket 2 and two screws (M2.5/12).\n \n \n \n Maddalena MVMOn Maddalena MVM water meters, the bracket must be placed upside down. You must hook the bracket on the left side of the water meter and screw it on the right side (with a screw, P2.6/8). Make sure that your analogue water meter has this option.\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Watermeter HWE-WTR-23\n By Homewizard\n Instantaneous water consumption measurement, Wi-Fi connection, adaptable to water meters on the European market and all compatible with Home Assistant\n \n \n 49.95€\n \n Buy Now\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nInstallation video HWE-WTR-23\n\nOfficial installation video\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nFirst settings via the official application\n\nIf you want to download the Homewizard application for Apple or Android, no worries, you just have to scan the Qrcode below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n More informations on Qrcode\n This QRcode allows you to download the Homewizard app directly for Android or Apple you have the choice between scanning this QRcode from your smartphone or clicking directly on the link below.\n \n Homewizard Apps for Smartphone\n \n\n\nBelow I made an animated gif of the first connection to the Official application, through the wifi settings, and finally the calibration of the module.\n\nAfter creating the account, follow the steps, nothing complicated:\n\n connect the smartphone to the module via the WatermeterSetup connection with the Setuppass code\n then switch to home wifi\n press the button to pair the module\n updates are done immediately if necessary\n finally perform a calibration\n option 1: you can add a rate per m3\n option 2: Homewizard offers an energy+ subscription for 0.99€/month which is useless if you go through Home Assistant\n\n\n\n\n\n At this point the installation should be operational.\n\n\nLet’s integrate the HWE-WTR-23 into Home Assistant\n\nMore than a year ago Homewizard officially announced its collaboration with Home Assistant by providing a near-perfect integration of its modules, and this is good news.\n\nHomewizard officially announces support for its products in Home Assistant what good news!\n\nAPI activation and functions\n\nFirst step: in order to integrate Homewizard products into home assistant, you will first need to activate the API in the Homewizard Smartphone application, to do this go to: cogwheels &gt;
