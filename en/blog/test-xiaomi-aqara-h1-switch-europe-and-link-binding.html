According to Xiaomi, these are high-end switches and compatible with Binding, so are they up to par?\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n AQARA - H1 ZIGBEE 3.0 WIRELESS DOUBLE WALL SWITCH - WRS-R02\n By Xiaomi\n Aqara H1 Wireless Dual Wall Switch (WRS-R02) is a Zigbee device and low power switch.\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now\n \n \n\n\n\nWhy this test combo\n\nThese two products attract my attention for a simple reason, according to the Chinese manufacturer they are compatible with the Zigbee Bindings connection. Inovelli integrates this function perfectly, then comes Legrand but when you look at their prices you get a nosebleed. So when you see that Xiaomi offers this function it’s worth looking into it.\n\nPresentation of the Aqara WS-EUK03 and WXKG15LM\n\nI chose to present this combo to you because I am going to test how the duo works and see if it lives up to my expectations.\n\nAqara WS-EUK03 (with neutral)\n\nOfficial website presentation\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n AQARA - H1 ZIGBEE 3.0 SMART WALL SWITCH (WITH NEUTRAL) - WS-EUK03\n By Xiaomi\n The Aqara H1 Smart Wall Switch (WS-EUK03) is a wall switch integrating a relay and based on the Zigbee 3.0 wireless communication protocol. Version with Neutral.\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Personally I opted for the version with neutral which has two big advantages like almost all switches on the market, it works in router mode and thus strengthens the market network, and measures the intensity, displays the information in Kwh, useful for the Energy tab of Home Assistant. As for the other versions, they are similar to the WS-EUK03 without neutral.\n\n\nFind all the interesting functions of this switch in the table below:\n\n\n \n \n Support of Round Wall Boxes\n Apart from 86 mm square wall boxes, the H1 EU also supports round European wall boxes.\n \n \n Premium Build and Metal Frame\n The H1 EU uses our award-winning, cleaner design preferred by the majority of our users. The metal frame makes it more rigid and durable.\n \n \n Convert to Wireless Switch Function\n The button of the switch can be remapped so that you will get an extra “wireless switch” while the light will be controlled by automations.\n \n \n Advanced Protection\n With overheat protection, you can be sure your home is safe and secure.\n \n \n Power Monitoring\n Check power consumption reports and usage statistics to track the efficiency of your electrical appliances.\n \n \n Extra Convenient Remote Control\n Compatible with most popular voice assistants and ecosystems: HomeKit, Alexa, Google, IFTTT* such as G2H, M1S and M2, Zigbee2mqtt and ZHA\n \n \n 2-Way Setup Support\n with Wireless Switch H1 Upgrade your existing 2-Way setup using the Wall Switch H1 EU with the Wireless Switch H1, which can be placed on top of the existing wall box used for secondary 2-Way switch.\n \n \n\n\n\n\nAqara has equipped this module with an NXP JN5189 chip which has the advantage of being high performance with very low energy consumption which integrates the Zigbee and Thread protocol and supports NFC\n\nNXP JN5189 chip\n\n\n\nAmong the important functions of the module we find:\n\n the switching or remote control function by automation\n measurement of consumption\n the 2-way binding function\n\n\nAqara H1 switch user manual\n\nAqara WXKG15LM (WRS-R02)\n\nOfficial website presentation\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n AQARA - H1 ZIGBEE 3.0 WIRELESS DOUBLE WALL SWITCH - WRS-R02\n By Xiaomi\n Aqara H1 Wireless Dual Wall Switch (WRS-R02) is a Zigbee device and low power switch.\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n 5 Year Battery Life\n Consumes very little energy, and can last for 5 year without changing batteries.\n \n \n High-Speed Click Mode\n For seamless control, the response time decreases down to 50 ms.\n \n \n Multiple Configurable Actions\n Single click, double click, long press, press 2 buttons simultaneously.\n \n \n Flexible Installation\n Put on a horizontal surface directly, stick onto a flat surface using the included adhesive pad or screw in place of the existing wall box.\n \n \n 2-Way Switch Setup Support with Wall Switch H1 EU\n Upgrade your existing 2-Way setup using the Wall Switch H1 EU with the Wireless Switch H1, which can be placed on top of the existing wall box used for secondary 2-Way switch.\n \n \n\n\n\n\nHere too Aqara has equipped this module with an NXP JN5189 chip which has the same advantages as the Aqara WS-EUK03 switch.\n\nThe interesting functions of this module:\n\n the lifespan of the battery (announced at 5 years)\n the number of actions available per switch\n the bindings function by Zigbee\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics of the Aqara WS-EUK03 and WXKG15LM\n\nAqara WS-EUK03\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n AQARA - H1 ZIGBEE 3.0 SMART WALL SWITCH (WITH NEUTRAL) - WS-EUK03\n By Xiaomi\n The Aqara H1 Smart Wall Switch (WS-EUK03) is a wall switch integrating a relay and based on the Zigbee 3.0 wireless communication protocol.

It makes the process more WAF and I think essential to ensure foolproof operation.\nExample: With such products it is possible to ask the electrician during construction to install a single switch per room (without two-way switch and without remote control switch) and to add additional wireless remote controls and thus reduce the cost of the installation bill.\n\nWhich switches offer Binding\n\nOn physical switches\n\n\n Xiaomi D1, E1 and H1\n Legrand by netamo Celiane wireless\n Aqara WXCJKG12LM\n\n\nLinking the Aqara WS-EUK03 and WXKG15LM\n\n \n \n \n \n Info\n It is important to keep the Aqara WXKG15LM (WRS-R02) battery-powered remote control awake during the process, setting the command mode and setting the binding links by pressing the switch every second otherwise the device will turn on quickly on standby to save energy\n \n\n\nVideos Links Bindings of Aqara WS-EUK03 and WXKG15LM\n\nWatch the video below, I have included these two products plus the Bindings, this video was made with Zigbee2mqtt and Home Assisitant. PS: I also tested it with Jeedom and it is functional (Jeedom recently integrated the official Zigbee2mqtt plugin). Little rant, this plugin is paid, you will have to lighten your wallet by €6 in order to be able to use it.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n Your browser does not support HTML5 videos. Here is\n a link to download the video.\n \n \n\n\nAfter a direct connection I realize that the Aqara WXKG15LM (WRS-R02) cannot process the difference between the left or right switch, both control the Aqara WS-EUK03 and It’s a shame because it makes this double switch unusable. No OTA update Firmware side.\n\nTo succeed in Binding, don’t forget to:\n\n after integration set the wired switch to control_relay\n after integrating the wireless switch, don’t forget to keep it awake (click every second) during the entire process\n adjusts the function of the wireless intercom on command\n removes existing endpoints\n creates an endpoint between the two devices\n\n\n\n Interestingly, the connection between the two devices is instantaneous, there is no significant delay &gt; 50ms between the moment you click on the remote control and reception on the switch.\n\n\nxiaomi.js todo bug aqara WXKG15LM (WRS-R02) \n\n\n\nWAF ( Women acceptance factor )\n\n\n Wife Acceptance Factor, Wife Approval Factor or Wife Appeal Factor (WAF), are design elements that increase the likelihood that a woman will approve the purchase of expensive consumer electronics products such as high–fidelity speakers, Home theater and personal computers.\nSleek, compact, discreet shapes and attractive colors are generally considered WAF. The term comes from a play on electronics jargon such as “form factor” and “power factor” and stems from the stereotype that men value performance and gadgetry, and women value visual and aesthetic factors. —Jeedom\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n AQARA - H1 ZIGBEE 3.0 SMART WALL SWITCH (WITH NEUTRAL) - WS-EUK03\n By Xiaomi\n The Aqara H1 Smart Wall Switch (WS-EUK03) is a wall switch integrating a relay and based on the Zigbee 3.0 wireless communication protocol. Version with Neutral.\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now\n \n \n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nAqara makes an interesting product on paper, however the price seems excessive for a quality that does not stand out from the rest. In addition, the direct link Bindings works but the Aqara WXKG15LM remote control (WRS-R02) does not currently allow you to dissociate the right/left switch and that’s a shame because the triggering is instantaneous. **which makes the strong function interesting but **makes this device half functional. I am waiting for a Xiaomi bridge to see if an update is likely to be available and thus integrate it into the Zigbee2mqtt system.\n\n If for you the Bindings mode is essential and you have to install switches in a new construction I advise you either to wait or to switch to Legrand but it will be twice as much Dear. And for this price you will not be able to measure consumption. It’s up to you.\n\n", "datePublished": "2024-02-21 13:09:00 +0100", "dateModified": "2024-02-21 13:09:00 +0100", "inLanguage": "en-GB", "author": { "@type": "Person", "name": null, "alternateName":

As for the other versions, they are similar to <strong>the WS-EUK03 without neutral</strong>.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Find all the interesting functions of this switch in the table below:</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><td>Support of Round Wall Boxes<td>Apart from 86 mm square wall boxes, the H1 EU also supports round European wall boxes.<tr><td>Premium Build and Metal Frame<td>The H1 EU uses our award-winning, cleaner design preferred by the majority of our users. The metal frame makes it more rigid and durable.<tr><td><strong class="blue">Convert to Wireless Switch Function</strong><td>The button of the switch can be remapped so that you will get an extra “wireless switch” while the light will be controlled by automations.<tr><td>Advanced Protection<td>With overheat protection, you can be sure your home is safe and secure.<tr><td><strong class="blue">Power Monitoring</strong><td>Check power consumption reports and usage statistics to track the efficiency of your electrical appliances.<tr><td>Extra Convenient Remote Control<td>Compatible with most popular voice assistants and ecosystems: HomeKit, Alexa, Google, IFTTT* such as G2H, M1S and M2, Zigbee2mqtt and ZHA<tr><td><strong class="blue">2-Way Setup Support</strong><td>with Wireless Switch H1 Upgrade your existing 2-Way setup using the Wall Switch H1 EU with the Wireless Switch H1, which can be placed on top of the existing wall box used for

I am waiting for a Xiaomi bridge to see if an update is likely to be available and thus integrate it into the Zigbee2mqtt system.</p><blockquote><p>If for <strong>you the Bindings mode is essential</strong> and you have to install switches in a new construction I advise you either to wait or to switch <strong>to Legrand</strong> but it will be <strong>twice as much Dear</strong>. <em>And for this price you will not be able to measure consumption.</em> It’s up to you.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="sourcelink"> <span class="titlesource">Source posts</span><ol><li class="contentlink"> <a rel="canonical" href="https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/WXKG15LM.html#aqara-wxkg15lm" target="_blank">www.zigbee2mqtt.io</a><i class="icos external-link-alt-solid"></i><li class="contentlink"> <a rel="canonical" href="https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/WS-EUK03.html#aqara-ws-euk03" target="_blank">www.zigbee2mqtt.io</a><i class="icos external-link-alt-solid"></i><li class="contentlink"> <a rel="canonical" href="https://www.domadoo.fr/fr/peripheriques/5725-aqara-interrupteur-mural-double-sans-fil-h1-zigbee-30-wrs-r02-6970504215023.html?domid=39" target="_blank">www.domadoo.fr</a><i class="icos external-link-alt-solid"></i><li class="contentlink"> <a rel="canonical" href="https://blog.domadoo.fr/87774-nouveaux-interrupteurs-zigbee-aqara/" target="_blank">blog.domadoo.fr</a><i class="icos external-link-alt-solid"></i></ol></div><div class="rating mt-4 mb-4 d-flex align-items-center"> <strong class="mr-1">Rating:</strong><div class="rating-holder"><div class="Stars" style="--rating: 3.8; --star-background: #FF6600" title="Rating of this product is 3.8 out of 5."></div></div></div><div class="authorbox mb-5 mt-5 pt-4 pb-4" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="row"><div class="wrapavname col-md-3 text-center"><picture> <source srcset="https://haade.fr/assets/images/generated/nico-110-5d88b8595.webp 1.0x" type="image/webp"> <source srcset="https://haade.fr/assets/images/generated/nico-110-c8508425c.png 1.0x" type="image/png"> <img class="author-thumb" itemprop="image" width="110" height="110" src="https://haade.fr/assets/images/generated/nico-110-c8508425c.png" alt="Nico"> </picture><p class="mt-4 mb-0 small text-center"> <a target="_blank" class="d-inline-block mx-1 text-dark" itemprop="url" href="/fr/auteur-nico/"><i class="ico link-solid"></i></a> <a target="_blank" class="d-inline-block mx-1 text-dark" itemprop="sameAs" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcXJ1ZsjEvQxuWJy7gH-A6w"><i class="icob youtube"></i></a> <a target="_blank" class="d-inline-block mx-1 text-dark" itemprop="sameAs" href="https://github.com/haade-administrator"><i class="icob github"></i></a> <a target="_blank" class="d-inline-block mx-1 text-dark" itemprop="sameAs" href="https://discordapp.com/widget?id=637642871738073091&theme=dark&username=Nicoxygen#5644"><i class="icob discord"></i></a> <a class="d-inline-block mx-1 text-dark" itemprop="email" href="mailto:nico@haade.fr"><i class="ico envelope-solid"></i></a></p></div><div class="col-md-9"><h4 itemprop="name">Nico</h4><p class="mt-3 mb-0" itemprop="description">Founding member of the Haade website, I have been passionate about home automation, computers and electronics for over 10 years.
