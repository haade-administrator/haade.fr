Why but not too much, I find that the connected function is not there, let me explain: The Welock connected locks can be unlocked via the Welock smartphone application and that’s it, it There is indeed a wifi bridge but I did not find integrations for the opensource systems Home Assistance, Jeedom, Openhab… .\n\n \n \n \n \n Info\n Haade.fr is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means to earn fees when creating links to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\n \n\n\n\n The wifi bridge just allows you to control the lock via the welock app remotely.\n\n\nCurrently the welock SECBNEBL51 only connects to the application via bluetooth so close to the lock, it’s good it’s secure but that’s not what we request to a current smart lock.\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Welock fingerprint lock SECBNEBL51\n By Welock\n Electronic fingerprint lock with Bluetooth WiFi RFID card for adjustable cylinder from 30 to 70 mm, electronic locking cylinder, Discount coupons: SECB51001\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Amazon\n \n \n \n\n\nIn case of shortages on the Amazon website you can also order the lock directly on the Welock website, it is priced at €189 Free delivery. But don’t worry with the following code: SINDRO50 it will only cost you €139**, of course it’s a little more expensive than on the Amazon site but it’s still reasonable.\n\nUnboxing\n\nConcerning the packaging nothing to say, it is very well done, the cardboard is of an interesting volume which will leave no room for doubts. Attention! do not throw away the cardboard once the installation is complete because you will find the unique identifier of the lock which will allow you to connect it to the application.\n\n\n\nIn the package you will find:\n\n well-written instructions in different languages\n the connected lock\n an allen key\n a key to perform a reset\n plus a screwdriver, additional screws\n green screw locking tips\n an extension and a screw for the Barrel\n as well as 3 RFID badges which will be used to unlock the mechanism in addition to unlocking by fingerprint.\n\n\nWelock SECBNEBL51 fingerprint lock user manual\n\n\n\nTo finish this overview of the packaging you will be able to realize that the lock is very well protected against the hazards of transport. But also the size of it.\n\n\n\nWelock organization chart SECBNEBL51\n\nBelow you will find all the flowcharts, representing the functions available on the lock’s digital screen.\n\nDigital print\n\nBelow is the flowchart to add/remove admin and user fingerprint\n\n\n\nadd/remove RFID card\n\nAs its name suggests, adds/modifies/controls the RFID cards provided with the device.\n\n\n\nother settings\n\nIn the other parameters you can modify:\n\n\n the language (English or German) the French is missing, too bad.\n Activates/deactivates the sound (beep).\n Enables/disables bluetooth (the application needs bluetooth to work).\n changes the date and time.\n\n\n\n\nThe fingerprint\n\nI must say that the operation and configuration by fingerprint is ultra responsive, very precise, in short, nothing to complain about.\n\nAdding batteries\n\nAdding the batteries involves handling the shell, starts with:\n\n\n unscrew the zinc protection using the allen key\n pulls on the end rubber sleeve without the screw\n adds batteries not supplied, type 3xAAA\n closes the sleeve and locks it using a screw provided in the package.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling the barrel extension\n\nThe Welock SECBNEBL51 lock is compatible with European type locks. If you have any doubts, do not hesitate to contact the team, they will quickly answer your questions service@welockglobal.com\n\nto do:\n\n\n unscrew the Zinc handle using the allen key\n remove the handle\n installs the extension and matches it to the corresponding punches and notches\n insert the long screw and tighten it thoroughly\n now you can put the zinc handle back in place and tighten the allen screw.\n\n\n\n By extending the barrel, the adjustment range will increase from 50 to 100mm.\n\n\n\n\n\n Personally, I did not need to place this extension during my tests.\n\n\nInstalling the Welock SECBNEBL51\n\nTo install the lock there too it’s not very complicated, however it will be necessary to dismantle the old barrel in order to replace the entire system. Depending on the situation, the installation can be more or less complex and long, in my case for example I had to go through the dismantling of the plastic fittings which was not so easy.\n\n\n Welock could probably have found a simpler system, by installing this lock on the door without needing to dismantle the existing mechanism as did Tedee with his connected lock.\n\n\nBarrel control\n\nWhen replacing the lock, and after dismantling the original barrel, compare the length of the barrel as well as the positioning of the thread for the screw holding it.\n\nIf this location is not identical you will certainly have to reverse the direction of the barrel; you will just need to attach the two circlips located on the Welock barrel and reverse the mechanism.\n\nRegarding the size if the original barrel is longer, do not forget to fix the extension provided with the Welock lock SECBNEBL51.\n\n\n\nInstalling the welock SECBNEBL51\n\nDepending on the case, the installation can be easy, the installation as well as the fixing of the screw holding the barrel did not cause me any problems. This is a scenario because in this specific case I could not leave the lock outside as it does not have the quality required to withstand the climatic conditions. It is rather intended for internal access doors to the building.\n\nStarts with:\n\n\n unscrew the barrel locking screw\n once dismantled prepare the welock lock by dismantling the zinc handle\n if necessary mount the extension\n pay attention to the direction of the barrel and compare with the original one\n if necessary you can swap the cylinder on the welock lock SECBNEBL51\n once in place locks using the original screw\n\n\n\n And there it is.\n\n\n\n\nWelock Application\n\nWelock Android\nWelock Apple store\n\nThe application will essentially serve you to unlock the lock using the smartphone or to unlock the lock in the event of an anomaly or insufficient lock battery.\n\nAs for the other functions, they will be rather secondary and therefore dispensable from the primary function of the lock.\n\n\n\nApplication functions\n\nYou will be able to manage:\n\n\n member authorizations by assigning the registration numbers of fingerprints, cards etc… (I don’t see the primary use of this function)\n Add or delete RFID cards with or without validity period (not bad for distributing cards to third parties)\n view history\n download recording details\n remove fingerprints without going through the lock\n synchronize the time (function available directly on the lock screen)\n access general settings\n\n\n\n\nbattery backup function\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n 10000mAh External Battery with 4 Integrated Cables\n By Charmast\n Functional power bank for Welock fingerprint lock emergency operation.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Amazon\n \n \n \n\n\nTo begin with, you should know that the battery life is between 10 and 12 months.\n\n \n \n \n \n Info\n Unlocking the lock in the event of battery malfunctions can only be done via the application, the power bank is there as a power source, the keys and fingerprints of the lock will not be not active\n \n\n\n\n\nTo use the emergency battery you will need a powerbank with an electrical output between 3.6 and 4.5v as well as a powerbank compatible cable and a USB-A output which could have been USB-C type. In fact I used the 5v output of the power bank which caused no problems with the lock.\n\nAdditional reduction coupons valid on the Amazon site exclusively for the Haade.fr site: SECB51001. For a Final price of €132.\n\nProduct advantages:\n\n\n Quick and easy installation\n Opening by smartphone, fingerprint and RFID badge\n Backup battery\n\n\nThe - of the product:\n\n\n Lack of compatibility with third-party applications on the market (Home Assistant, Openhab, Jeedom, Homey, etc.).\n Good finish but little work (once installation is done)\n French translation non-existent\n lock intended for interior door (no IP65-66 protection)\n display of functions on the lock a little cheap\n USB-A connection\n\n\nAdditional reduction coupons valid on the Amazon site exclusively for the Haade.fr site: SECB51001. For a Final price of €132.\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Welock fingerprint lock SECBNEBL51\n By Welock\n Electronic fingerprint lock with Bluetooth WiFi RFID card for adjustable cylinder from 30 to 70 mm, electronic locking cylinder, Discount coupons: SECB51001\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Amazon\n \n \n \n\n\nIn case of shortages on the Amazon website you can also order the lock directly on the Welock website, it is priced at €189 Free delivery. But don’t worry with the following code: SINDRO50 it will only cost you €139**, of course it’s a little more expensive than on the Amazon site but it’s still reasonable.\n\n \n \n \n \n Info\n Haade.fr is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means to earn fees when creating links to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\n \n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis lock is good because it will allow you to do without keys and thus avoid any problems related to them, the entire mechanism and assembly is of good quality, the fingerprint system reacts like clockwork.\nAttention: this lock is mainly dedicated to doors protected by bad weather, I doubt that it is resistant to climatic conditions. In addition I did not find any information on the protection index.\nPersonally, the application needs to be reviewed, I find it quite poorly made, compared to other applications dedicated to connected locks. But you can easily do without it.\nAs for the emergency connection in the event of battery failure, it is well thought out, but I doubt that the day that happens you will have a power bank with a cable to help you out.\n\n\n Paulo will test it on his front door and will give you a little video feedback.\n\n", "datePublished": "2024-07-17 10:15:00 +0200", "dateModified": "2024-07-17 10:15:00

<strong>but not too</strong> connected fingerprint lock, the Welock SECBNEBL51. <strong>Why but not too much</strong>, I find that the connected function is not there, <strong>let me explain:</strong> The Welock connected locks can be unlocked via the Welock smartphone application and that’s it, it There is indeed a wifi bridge but <strong>I did not find integrations for the opensource systems Home Assistance, Jeedom, Openhab… .</strong></p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><div class="alert-icon"> <i class="icos info-circle-solid"></i></div><div class="alert-text"><h4

SECBNEBL51 only <strong>connects to the application via bluetooth</strong> so close to the lock, it’s good it’s secure but that’s not what we request to a current smart lock.</p><div

But you can easily do without it. As for the emergency connection in the event of battery failure, it is well thought out, <strong>but I doubt that the day that happens you will have a power bank with a cable to help you
