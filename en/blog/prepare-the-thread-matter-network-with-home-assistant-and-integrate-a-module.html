We know all the advantages and disadvantages of wifi, but have you ever heard about Thread?\n\nThis article comes after an integration of a new product that I will present in a future article the Tado-X, I wanted to integrate it directly into Home Assistant through Matter and Thread because it is compatible with these protocols, and I did not want to use the entire Tado environment, I finally succeeded but it was not that easy!\n\nMatter + Thread Explanations\n\nLet’s get back to our sheep what is Matter\n\nMatter is an Object-oriented protocol, it is capable of managing the connection-operation and control of connected objects. Matter can’t handle network protocols directly, which is why manufacturers pair it with wifi or thread.\n\nWhat is Thread?\n\nThread is a low-power, low-latency wireless mesh networking protocol similar to frequency and Zigbee.\nLike Zigbee, Thread solves the complexities of IoT by addressing challenges such as interoperability, range, security, energy, and reliability, they have no single point of failure, and include the ability to self-heal.\n\nHow ​​does Threas differ from Zigbee or Z-wave in operation?\n\nWell, Thread devices integrate seamlessly into the IP networks widely available in our larger homes and do not require proprietary gateways or translators. This reduces infrastructure investment and complexity, eliminates potential points of failure, and reduces maintenance burdens. Thread also securely connects devices to the cloud, making it easier to control IoT products and systems from devices such as mobile phones and tablets.\n\nThread Operation Diagram\n\n\n\n\n We understand better why manufacturers are increasingly moving towards this protocol.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIn a Matter+Thread environment, Matter takes care of the management and operation of the product, while Thread is there as a data transporter on the network.\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Box HomeAssistant Green\n By Nabu Casa\n Box Home Assistant Green on sale at domadoo for less than €100\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Domadoo\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nThread and Home Assistant\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n\n a box with home assistant with HAOS\n an ezsp key type skyconnect configured with a thread firmware\n Install a Matter server on HA\n install a Thread server on HA\n A smartphone with companion installed\n\n\n\n\nTo arrive at integrating a Thread and openthread compatible product do not hesitate to check the following logo on the product label, it works with thread via a border router, a control key that we will configure in home assistant.\n\n\n\nLet’s prepare a zigbee type ezsp key\n\nAll keys available on the market with the silicon labs EFR32MGXX chip are likely to integrate a thread firmware, you will find on the Darkxst Github directory several firmwares compatible with different keys.\nFor a practical aspect I will use the Zigbee Home Assistant ZBT-1 key formerly called Skyconnect. To update or change the firmware, nothing complicated. Go to the official manufacturer website, at the bottom of this page you will find a update firmware icon. Plug the key/dongle into your PC via USB and click on the button.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Zigbee Key and Thread ZBT 1 Skyconnect\n By Nabucasa\n Nabu Casa Home Assistant key compatible with Zigbee or Thread\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Domadoo\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nAnother solution: If you have a zbt-1 key, Home Assistant allows you to directly configure it in Thread via a simple link. In this case, leave the key connected to the HAOS Home Assistant bos, go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Hardware\n\n\n\n\n PS: There is a Multi Pan function which means compatible with Zigbee and Thread at the same time, however this function is still in development phase I advise you not to use it for the moment.\n\n\nOfficial article talking about the multiprotocl subject on the skyconnect zbt-1 key\n\nLet’s start by creating a Matter server\n\nNothing complicated, just click on the link below, it will allow you to download the Matter add-on, then you don’t have to configure anything and you can install it directly.\n\n\n\nTo finish, you have to add the created Matter device, to do this go to Settings &gt; Devices and Services &gt; Discoveries and click on Add Matter.\n\nANOTHER MATTER SOLUTION, if you have already installed a Matter compatible product in your home automation network, then you just have to go to\n\nSettings &gt; Devices and Services &gt; Discoveries, there you should have Matter proposed, by simply clicking on it, you leave the box checked: Use the official Matter Server add-on in the Supervisor and it will automatically install the Matter server.\n\n\n\nLet’s Install the Openthread Server Essential\n\nOpenThread released by Google is an open source implementation of Thread®. Google released OpenThread to make the networking technology used in Google Nest products more widely available to developers, to accelerate the development of products for the smart home and commercial buildings.\n\n\n\nStart by downloading and installing the Openthread server, (link above) and before launching it for the first time you will have to select your zigbee key in the settings and check the baudrate at 460800. As in the image below then you can start the server.\n\n\n\n\n Here are the two servers Matter and Openthread are installed and operational but it’s not over.\n\n\nLet’s continue, now we will have to configure a border router it is equivalent to a coordinator for Zigbee/Z-wave, check that the two servers are started and operational, go to Settings &gt; Devices and Services &gt; Discoveries and click on the Thread discovery, if there is no Thread discovery, go to Add an integration and choose Thread. To finish check that your coordinator is correctly back in Thread. Still in Devices and Services Click on the previously configured Thread integration then go to configure, you should have a border router ha-thread-XXX\n\n\n\nIf you want more information about Thread and HA go to the official link, everything is indicated, especially if there are several border routers like Google Home or Apple Home kit that are already available at your place.\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Box HomeAssistant Green\n By Nabu Casa\n Box Home Assistant Green on sale at domadoo for less than €100\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Domadoo\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nSmartphone and Companion Settings\n\nIf you want to add a new product whether it is under Matter/wifi or Matter/thread you will have no choice but to install the Companion application for android or Apple. Because everything happens on smartphone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n More informations on Qrcode\n This QRcode allows you to download the Companion app directly for Android or Apple you have the choice between scanning this QRcode from your smartphone or clicking directly on the link below.\n \n Smartphone Companion Apps\n \n\n\nBut before you can add Matter-based Thread devices, your phone needs to know the credentials of the newly created Thread network.\n\nTo share the credentials with your Android phone, open the Home Assistant Companion app.\nIn the Companion app, go to Settings &gt; Companion app &gt; Troubleshooting , then select Sync Thread credentials .\nFollow the on-screen instructions.\nResult: You will see a confirmation that the Home Assistant Thread credentials have been added to this device.\n\nTo share credentials with your iPhone, open the Home Assistant Companion app.\nGo to Settings &gt; Devices &amp; Services , select Thread integration ,Select Configure under Services .\nAt the bottom of the preferred network area, select Send credentials to phone .\n\nYou can find all the additional information on the official link below\n\nmore information about Thread and HA go to the official link\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Zigbee Key and Thread ZBT 1 Skyconnect\n By Nabucasa\n Nabu Casa Home Assistant key compatible with Zigbee or Thread\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Domadoo\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nConclusion\n\nHere is a few steps installation that will allow you to welcome all new products compatible with Matter/Thread router border, on your Home Assistant installation, I find this interesting integration step because the Thread protocol remains a very good choice especially when faced with wifi!. After this manipulation, the integration of a tado-x thermostatic faucet directly into ha is child’s play\n\n\n\n", "datePublished": "2025-01-30 16:20:00 +0100", "dateModified": "2025-01-30 16:20:00 +0100", "inLanguage": "en-GB", "author": { "@type": "Person", "name": "Nico", "alternateName": "Nico", "description": "Founding member of the Haade website, I have been passionate about home automation, computers and electronics for over 10 years.

This reduces infrastructure investment and complexity, eliminates potential points of failure, and reduces maintenance burdens. <strong>Thread also securely connects devices to the cloud,</strong> making it easier to control IoT products and systems from devices such as mobile phones and tablets.</p><p><strong>Thread Operation Diagram</strong></p><picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px)
