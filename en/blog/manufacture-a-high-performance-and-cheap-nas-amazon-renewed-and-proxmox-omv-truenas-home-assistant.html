Little icing on the cake you can also easily install HomeAssistant OS (HAOS) and the Frigate NVR manager using Proxmox VMs and thus easily combine NAS and Home Automation on the system.\n\n \n \n \n \n Info\n Haade.fr is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\n \n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n A refurbished Mini Lenovo or HP PC with Intel I5 minimum\n 8 GB DDram minimum\n 128-256GB hard drive\n A DD docking station with USB 3.0\n a USB key (to integrate Proxmox)\n\n\nThe Heart of the system\n\nMany sites extol the merits of mini-PCs with surrealist power, but often when you want to invest in purchasing such a device equipped with an i5 processor or equivalent the prices skyrocket. But you might as well equip yourself with a powerful reconditioned mini-pc. There are plenty of them on the market like the Lenovo thinkcentre M7X or HP EliteDesk 800 and if you do well you could acquire one for barely more than €100, they have the advantage of being complete and suitable for multi-service servers that can accommodate a high-performance NAS manager.\n\nLenovo Thinkcentre\n\nThe Lenovo thinkcentre is small, you can upgrade the capacity of the RAM memory and even integrate a Google Coral M2 A+E instead of the M2 key A+E wifi card. In addition, the case is made of steel, and the USB ports are all 3.2 which can reach a theoretical speed rate of 20Gbs.\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n By Lenovo\n (155€) Lenovo ThinkCentre M710q Tiny Intel Quad Core i5 256 GB SSD 8 GB Memory Windows 11 Pro with W-LAN Business Desktop Computer Mini PC (Refurbished)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Amazon\n \n \n \n\n\nHP Elitedesk 800\n\nAs with the Lenovo, the HP Elitedesk is very small, you can also upgrade the memory up to 32GB easily. It also has an M2 A+E wifi card so here too you could integrate a Google Coral M2 A+E, the case is also made of steel and all USB ports are 3.0 with a maximum theoretical speed of 5Gbs.\n\ntechnical files HP Elitedesk 88 g2\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n By HP\n (114€) HP EliteDesk 800 G2 Desktop Computer Mini USDT Intel Quad Core i5 256 GB SSD 8 GB Win 10 Pro MAR Ultra Slim Mini PC (refurbished)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Amazon\n \n \n \n\n\nNAS disk storage\n\nNeither of the two mentioned above can integrate 3.5” hard drives, however they can integrate in addition to the Nvme disk a second hard disk in SSD format. If you want to make a NAS you will need more backup storage then you can equip yourself with an Orico docking station for example which will allow you to connect several disks via USB 3.0.\n\n\n This has the advantage of not needing to tinker, you connect and off you go.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n By Orico\n (87 - 119€) ORICO USB 3.0 Docking Station for 2.5 and 3.5 inch Hard Drives/SSDs, Tool-Free External HDD Dock, Supported Offline Cloning, Capacity Up to 5 x 18TB (6558US3-C)\n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Aliexpress\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Amazon\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n By Sabrent\n (€89) 2.5 and 3.5 inch SATA Hard Drive Docking Station, 4 Bays SSD/HDD to USB 3.2 Adapter, External Drive Enclosure Hard, Offline Cloning, Supports UASP, USB Cable Included (DS-U3B4)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Amazon\n \n \n \n\n\nHard drives\n\nA NAS needs special disks, which are RED Hard disks, and this is what is the most expensive in terms of equipment for a NAS. With the Seagate 4TO you can buy 4dd for around €400 and make your NAS.\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n By Seagate\n (4 x 105€) IronWolf Pro 4 TB, NAS HDD internal hard drive, CMR 3.5 inch SATA 6 Gbit/s 7,200 rpm, 128 MB cache, for NAS RAID, Rescue services valid for 3 years (ST4000NE001)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Amazon\n \n \n \n\n\nThe Final Price\n\nComing back to our point, if you follow this purchasing model, the installation will cost you approximately €240 without the DD and €640 with. If you decide to modify the RAM you will have to add 86€ for 32 GB and if you want to add a Google Coral costs 45€ Delivered.\n\nIn short for 771€ you will have a complete system with 16TB of storage and able to accommodate OMV or TrueNAS for the NAS server, Frigate for the NVR part and Home Assistant OS version for the home automation side. Not that expensive for an all in one.\n\nInstallation\n\nProxmox\n\n \n \n \n \n Info\n If you use ZFS on Proxmox or through Proxmox (Truenas or Omv) I strongly advise you to increase the memory capacity to 32GB\n \n Memories Crucial SODIMM DDR4\n \n\n\nFor the installation of Proxmox, nothing very complicated, start by downloading the ISO file, copy it to a USB key using the Rufus/Ventoy/Balenaetcher, restart the PC and boot from the USB key (often F8 key), then answer the two three questions and that’s it. To finish, connect to IP address: 8006\n\nProxmox VE 8.2.X download link in iso format\n\nFind below the page of the site bringing together the VM or LXC installation scripts for the different software to be installed for the following steps.\n\nAutomated shel installers script for Proxmox VE\n\nChange deposits\n\nBy default, Proxmox update repositories include business repositories subject to a paid subscription. So in the animated gif below I show you how to deactivate corporate deposits and simply add a No-Subscription deposit. Finally, update the packages and make Proxmox updates.\n\nGo to the Proxmox &gt; Updates &gt; Deposits tab to change the deposits, then go to update, click on refresh and update.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n Info\n Proxmox does not recommend using the no-subscription repository in a production environment, as it is less followed than the normal enterprise repository\n \n\n\nDisable display on server screen after 60 seconds\n\nIn order to optimize energy saving it is possible to deactivate the screen display after 60 seconds.\n\nTo do this, edit the following file:\n\nnano /etc/default/grub\n\nThen modify the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=”” by:\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=&quot;consoleblank=60&quot;\n\nFinally, apply the change:\n\nupdate-grub\n\nTo finish restart the system\n\nreboot\n\nBefore continuing with the following steps\n\nThere are many ways to install images into a container:\n\n\n either directly with LXC Proxmox containers\n either install an LXC docker container with portainer and install OMV and/or Frigate through this container.\n if you install OMV you can decide to integrate Docker into OMV and install Frigate in the architecture.\n\n\nAll options are acceptable, it’s up to you to see how you want to build your architecture.\n\nOMV\n\nInstalling omv is ultra simplified thanks to the tteck script. Go to the Proxmox tab and click on shell, to access the terminal then paste the script and launch everything, after a few minutes the installation is complete. You can go to OMV.\n\nAutomated OMV shell install script for Proxmox VE\n\nGeneral rule 8GB of sodimm DDR4 memory at 2133Mhz is enough to run these 1 virtual machine, and two LXC containers. The most demanding remains Frigate, however if you decide to have a system that does not confine itself within its limits or if you decide to set up a RAID system in ZFS you will need more memories, I therefore advise you to use some add/replace depending on the PC chosen.\n\n\n\nLook at the characteristics of your PC in my case they are DDR4 2666Mhz SODIMMs:\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n By Crucial\n (86€) Crucial RAM CT2K16G4SFRA32A 32GB Kit (2x16GB) DDR4 3200MHz CL22 (or 2933MHz or 2666MHz) Portable Memory\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Amazon\n \n \n \n\n\nTrueNas Scale\n\nUnlike OMV, the installation of Truenas is not automated in Proxmox you will need to create a Virtual Machine from the .iso image of Truenas Scale.\n\n\n\nAlso Truenas Scale is installed in a VM which is much more demanding than a container, plus the disk management system is only possible in ZFS RAID, so it will absolutely be necessary to increase the size of the memory and switch to at least 16GB but I advise you 32GB.\n\n\n To choose I advise you OMV compared to TrueNAS which will be less greedy overall because it can be installed in a container.\n\n\nBelow is a video from Zatoufly which covers the installation of Truenas in passtrought in Proxmox.\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nHome Assistant\n\nAs with OMV or Frigate, installing Homeassistant OS is just as simple thanks to the tteck script, you will even have several scripts to install Home Assistant but only one will allow you to install HAOS.\n\n \n \n \n \n Info\n Be careful to adjust the number of cores and RAM according to the other two for the stability of your system.\n \n\n\nAutomated HAOS shell installer script for Proxmox VE\n\n\n\nFrigate NVR\n\nHere too there is a script to install Frigate in an LXC Proxmox container, follow the steps and you will have a positive result.\n\nIf after this you encounter difficulties with hardware acceleration you can install frigate through docker by installing docker in Proxmox. So you can configure the Frigate instance with all the necessary options.\n\nAutomated Frigate shell install script for Proxmox VE\n\n\n But if you decide to use OMV as a NAS then I advise you to install it through the LXC docker container next to frigate and not via the script.\n\n\n\n\nBelow some information links regarding Frigate\n\nFrigate NVR\n\nFrigate NVR Documentation\n\nFrigate google Coral\n\nGoogle Coral A+E M2 key\n\nIf you use Frigate I strongly advise you to use a Google Coral and if like me you use a Lenovo Thinkcentre M710Q PC you can connect the coral instead of the internal M2 WIFI card finally if you don’t have need WIFI (some PCs do not have the integrated WiFi card but the socket is present.)\n\nGoogle coral purchase attractive price A+E M2 key on BuyZero €45 delivered\n\n \n \n \n \n Info\n Haade.fr is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\n \n\n\nPerformance\n\nIn order to understand the server load and RAM management I will provide you with screenshots based on the installed services, they take into account the Lenovo Thinkcentre PC with 4 cores and 8GB of total RAM.\n\nOMV-Frigate-HomeAssistant\n\n\n\nTrueNas-Frigate-HomeAssistant\n\n\n\nOMV-HomeAssistant\n\n\n\nFrigate-HomeAssistant\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a simple way to work with a refurbished mini PC and use it as a NAS, NVR and Home Automation server at the same time. And thus optimize the return cost of such a system.\nIn alphabetical order, the most demanding of RAM are:\n\n TrueNAS (16GB mini)\n Frigate (depends on the integration of a Google Coral)\n OMV (depends on RAID or ZFS, from 4GB to 16GB minimum)\n Home Assistant (2GB mini)\n\n\n\n I still advise you to increase the RAM memory, which is often 8GB, and increase it to 32GB so you can accumulate VMs.\n\n", "datePublished": "2024-07-03 21:20:00 +0200", "dateModified": "2024-07-03 21:20:00 +0200", "inLanguage": "en-GB", "author": { "@type": "Person", "name": "Nico", "alternateName": "Nico",
