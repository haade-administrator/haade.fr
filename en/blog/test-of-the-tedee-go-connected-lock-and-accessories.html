For the record, I asked Tedee to provide me with the Pro version which looks more attractive, but the brand favors this range for installation by professionals and found it more relevant to send me the Tedee Go aimed at the general public.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n TEDEE GO CONNECTED LOCK (GREY) - TEDEE\n By Tedee\n Tedee's new smart lock.

Big positive point for the brand. However, the depth is quite significant which still offers a good grip.\n\n&lt;img class=\"pictinpost lazyload\" src=\"https://haade.fr/assets/images/generated/posts/120/comparatif-dimension-serrure-connecte-du-marche-240-b3ace0c9b.png\" alt=\"comparison of the size of the tedee go lock versus the competition--img width=\"940\" height=\"267\"\"&gt;\n\nInstallation and Advantage\n\nWell you will find all the information on the web and on the future video which will be released soon on our Youtube channel.\n\n\n It installs very quickly and effortlessly, I guarantee it 👍\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n Your browser does not support HTML5 videos. Here is\n a link to download the video.\n \n \n\n\n\n Keep your current hardware: You will install the Tedee GO in a few minutes, on the current cylinder, without having to replace the hardware, and all without making a single hole.\n Keeps the keys: Tedee GO is a key turner, you don’t have to replace the key or twist it, the Tedee GO lock fits onto the key. You can of course open from the outside with your traditional key.\n Virtual keys: Share access to the home with family, friends or tenants. Facilitates access with virtual keys in the Tedee app, controlling who enters, when, for how long and at what time.\n Your personal doorman: Relax with simple features – set Tedee GO to automatically lock when you leave or return home.\n\n\nlock options Tedee Go with the app\n\n\n Automatically lock the door when the lock is unlocked\n Automatically lock the door when the lock is semi-locked\n automatic unlocking when you are near the door (bluetooth)\n Latch (without exterior handle chosen to open the door entirely)\n configure the physical button of the lock (unlock/lock, automatic closing with delay, time delay)\n Calibration\n Alert on unlocked lock\n Emergency unlock option\n\n\n\n\nI repeat throughout this thread, this lock is a delight in terms of installation and installation. Tedee signs it flawlessly. If you are looking for a lock without tinkering and without having done the science to configure it then the Tedee Go is made for you 👍.\n\n\n\nQuality of the Tedee Go\n\nThe system protection handle is tinted an aluminum gray, but I’m a little disappointed because it’s not, it’s definitely ABS plastic, probably a choice made by the company and certainly because of the weight of the whole thing.\n\n\n\nThe noise in all this 💩\n\nSo I looked a little on the web, there are videos where you can hear this lock in operation, but no one really talks about it, yet this lock is noisy.\n\n\n If like me you have teenagers at home, the lock will trigger eczema in you! …\n\n\nThe video was taken about 60cm from the lock with the smartphone, the decibels rise to 70, marcel heats up…\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n TEDEE GO CONNECTED LOCK (BLACK) - TEDEE\n By Tedee\n Tedee's new smart lock. Quick to install. Easy to like. Black model.\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now\n \n \n\n\n\nBattery consumption\n\nThis tab will be modified throughout the month to have more real data smoothing\n\nThe module works with 3 CR123 batteries, these are lithium batteries which are relatively expensive. You find them on the internet between 2 and 4€ depending on the quality/brand.\nI am at 9 days of operation, the autonomy is 94% with the original batteries.\nThe manufacturer gives a lifespan of 6 to 8 months for an average of 8 operations per day or 4 openings/closings.\n\nApart from the first day I am below 8 operations, according to the data collected we would be at 150 days of autonomy which represents 5 months of operation on battery\n\n\n If you rent seasonally, don’t forget to change the batteries regularly to hope that they last all season or train the concierge to know how to change them. !\n\n\nProduct advantages:\n\n The application (difficult to do better)\n installation (super practical)\n Bluetooth connectivity\n manufacturing quality\n\n\nThe - of the product:\n\n Battery module 3 x CR123\n energy consuming\n plastic handle\n very noisy\n Bridge required to connect it to external home automation\n the price 165€\n\n\nTedee Bridge for Tedee Go\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n TEDEE - BRIDGE BLUETOOTH/WI-FI\n By Tedee\n Tedee's new smart lock. Quick to install. Easy to like. Gray model.\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now\n \n \n\n\n\nThe Tedee Bridge wireless router allows you to control the Tedee GO connected lock via the Internet, and allows you to benefit from the API in order to easily control it via a home automation box, in my case Home-Assistant. Is it necessary! Personally, if you are interested in home automation then buy the Tedee bridge.\n\nThe Bridge is well made, nothing to say about the packaging and design. As you may have noticed, there is no thread, but you could add one. Originally you fit the bridge onto the socket and plug it in. Then you start the app and follow the guide, 2 minutes later the bridge will take over the tedee Go lock and it’s f.i.n.i.s.h.e.d.\n\n\n\nWell you know having a connected lock is good, using it with an application that is 100% functional is better, but if you are like me and you use several brands or protocols, centralize all in a single application, it’s still a great comfort.\n\nFor the record, one day a mechanic came to my house to change the tires on the car, anyway, he started talking about his solar system, and the control, so I veered off on home automation, logic. And then he begins to take out the laptop and show me various applications to control everything he has automated.\n\n\n And I said to myself, how does he manage to get out of this, it’s the smartphone that must be heating up!\n\n\nTechnical characteristics\n\n\n \n \n Model\n TBV1.0\n \n \n Weight\n 51.6g\n \n \n Dimensions\n 64.5mm x 63.5mm x 28mm\n \n \n Operating temperature\n 10-40°C (indoor only)\n \n \n Operating humidity\n max. 65%\n \n \n Made in\n Poland, EU\n \n \n Power supply\n 5V = 300mA\n \n \n Electrical connection\n Power outlet (included) or micro USB (cable not included)\n \n \n Wi-Fi communication\n 2.4 GHz\n \n \n Bluetooth communication\n BLE 5.0, 2.4GHz\n \n \n Security protocol\n TLS 1.3\n \n \n Recommended configuration\n max. 2m from Tedee Lock; 1-10m from Wi-Fi router\n \n \n Works with smart home systems\n Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Homey, Fibaro, Grenton, eeDomus, ConsolomioJeedom, Home-Assistant, etc…\n \n \n\n\nProduct advantages:\n\n extra installation and integration\n\n\nThe - of the product:\n\n the price (79€)\n\n\n\n After Tedee Go, the bridge is a treat in terms of installation and configuration in the Tedee application. You will appreciate this simplicity!\n\n\nTedee Keypad passcode\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n TEDEE - BLUETOOTH CODE KEYPAD\n By Tedee\n Create unique five- to eight-digit access codes and open doors without using your smartphone.\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now\n \n \n\n\n\n\n Certainly this keyboard is not cheap, 99€ just the price leaves one wondering, but we continue on a good path\n\n\n\n\nBut frankly it remains an interesting discovery, of remarkable quality, it does what we ask of it, with integration into the application as simple as Tedee Go and Bridge. It works via Bluetooth so it must be at a certain maximum distance from the Tedee Go for reasons of coverage and security. The product is very well made with thick plastics and molded on the back.\n\nOperation details\n\n\n\n\n Unlock the door without a smartphone using a PIN code\n Installation in just a few minutes, powered by 3 VARTA AAA batteries. Installation with glue or screws, even outdoors.\n Choose a 5 to 8 digit code and define, modify and assign PIN codes via the mobile app wherever you are\n Manages up to 100 active PIN codes and assigns unique codes to users for complete control of access and activity history.\n Finally Share access simply by giving the logical PIN code! NO !.\n\n\nNo risk taken\n\nNo data is stored in the keyboard. It only connects to the tedee connected lock which operates via a secure cloud.\n\nTedee digital code option\n\n\n\nThe Tedee digital code is not left out in terms of options, you can configure:\n\n\n the sound\n the backlight\n activate a doorbell button notification\n locking without pin code\n\n\n\n\nAs I said, the products in the Tedee range are very well made, the application is full of configurable options and that’s a real plus.\n\nFeatures\n\n\n \n \n Model\n TKV 1.0\n \n \n Weight\n 120 g (without batteries), 155 g (with 3 AAA batteries)\n \n \n Dimensions\n 48mm x 135mm x 28mm\n \n \n Power supply\n 3 AAA batteries included\n \n \n Battery life\n according to battery manufacturer’s instructions\n \n \n Bluetooth communication\n Bluetooth BLE 5.0 2.4 Ghz\n \n \n IP protection rating\n IP65\n \n \n\n\nProduct advantages:\n\n manufacturing quality\n batteries provided\n very professional operation\n superb integration into the app\n easy wall installation and screws provided\n change the code remotely\n\n\nThe - of the product:\n\n the price 99€ (very expensive for a digital code)\n\n\nSo know if this Digicode is useful to you?\n\nYes, if people (children, seasonal tenants) must have the key and do not have a telephone or do not want to install the Tedee application.\n\nTedee product instructions\n\nTedee Go installation instructions and user manual\n\nTedee Bridge installation instructions and user manual\n\nInstallation instructions and user manual for the Tedee access code keypad\n\nThe Tedee application\n\nGoogle playstore: Tedee\n\nApple AppStore: Tedee\n\nI’m not a fan of home automation through multiple applications, but rather for all in one that’s why systems like Jeedom or Home-assistant exist, fortunately there are these solutions, but for the moment they are not as complete as the Tedee application, You will still be able to control the lock!\n\nThe Tedee application is very well done, integrating the brand’s products only takes a few seconds and configuration is simplified. everything happens via QRCode and a Bluetooth connection apart from the bridge where a wifi setting is necessary (2.4 and 5Ghz compatible), here too I encountered no problems. As soon as your module is recognized, the application already offers an update which only takes a few seconds and all transferred by Bluetooth.\n\n\n frankly I have rarely seen an application that is so optimized and easy to use.\n\n\nTedee pairing\n\nThe Tedee modules (Go, Bridge and digicode) are equipped with Bluetooth as well as qrcodes on the product and on the instructions for pairing, only the digicode does not have a qrcode on the product. oblique safety guard. At the request of the app scan the qrcode of the new product and it will be integrated immediately, if an update is available it will be done directly at lightning speed. ⚡\n\nGuest Access Sharing\n\nThe Smartphone Application is well designed to generate access with various settings as well as sending automatic emails, but I am disappointed because the person must download the app to be able to use this access, a link in the form of buttons to click would have been simpler because if you do seasonal rental the customer may be reluctant to install this type of app. Well there is still the Tedee Digicode which will lighten your workload a little more. wallet.\n\n\n\nBut this is not inevitable, the web portal of Tedee will allow you to refine the management of links or codes access depending on one or more locks but also depending on various organizations and reservation applications, it seems complete so I will write an article specifically on the management of connected locks from the Tedee brand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n TEDEE GO CONNECTED LOCK (BLACK) - TEDEE\n By Tedee\n Tedee's new smart lock. Quick to install. Easy to like. Black model.\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now\n \n \n\n\n\nTedee Compatibility\n\nTedee API\n\nAn API in constant evolution available here\n\n\n\nThe brand shows compatibility with Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit or Homey but also Fibaro, eedomus, Loxone, neuronhouse, Jeedom, Ampio and Home-Assistant\n\n\n In all these cases you will need the Tedee Bridge\n\n\nwith bridge\n\n Home assistant\n Jeedom (plugin €4)\n Fibaro\n Eedomus\n Loxone\n etc…\n\n\nHome Assistant integration\n\nAnd yes the Tedee Go lock is partially compatible with home assistant but to do so you will ideally need the bridge but not obligatory, you could use the Tedee Go directly with HA through of homekit if you already have a homekit bridge but you will not have access to all the functions.\n\nWith the Tedee bridge\n\nOnce the bridge is configured via the official Tedee application, go to the settings and activate the API. Once activated, go to the API information and retrieve the Token key as well as the IP address, see the screenshot above\n\nThen the rest happens in Home-Assistant in a way that is more than a simple click directly on the button below\n\n\n\nEnter the IP address as well as the token and you will have directly all the information which will come up in Home Assistant (for the moment only the lock and the bridge will come up), I don’t have too much concern for the integration of the others components because the API is very complete. You can also participate in the integration project because there is a python library integration and the corresponding github\n\nRendering home-assistant and Tedee Go\n\n\n\nOn the Tedee application I have a bridge, a Tedee Go and a Digicode installed, and currently only the Bridge and the Tedee Go are recognized. The Bridge does not include functions to control.\nFor the Tedee Go lock, you will find the main locking function as well as information that I was unable to reconcile with the Tedee application.\n\n\n Like the duration of the mechanism at 2 (which should be an opening delay)\n Mechanism activated…\n semi-locked (well this is the option on the app).\n\n\n\n\nBelow I made an Animated Gif of how unlocking works and all without going through the Tedee cloud (because we use the API call). The operation under Home Assistant of the Tedee Go is super interesting.\n\nBecause you can choose between unlocking the handle or unlocking with action on the latch, unlike the Tedee app or you must select a latch option beforehand before you can use it.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n TEDEE GO CONNECTED LOCK (GREY) - TEDEE\n By Tedee\n Tedee's new smart lock. Quick to install. Easy to like. Black model.\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now\n \n \n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Tedee Go lock, the Tedee Bridge and the Digicode are successful installations and integrations into the world of the Tedee brand. The whole thing is manufactured in Europe (Poland) and it is a good thing.\n\nThe Tedee Go connected lock is a good lock but has 2 negative points, one it is noisy and two it is energy-consuming.\n\n\n If noise is the least of your worries then I recommend Tedee Go smart lock, otherwise pass your turn.\n\n\n", "datePublished": "2024-04-22 11:00:00 +0200", "dateModified":
