This kit comes with:\n\n\n instructions\n rewritable 13.56 MHz RFID tags\n a drilling guide\n wrenches and screwdrivers\n screws and wall plugs.\n\n\n\nThe doorphone can be disassembled using an Allen key and a screw located under the bottom. You then have access to the doorbell display for easy replacement of the identification labels.\n\nOn the back, there are two removable connectors that allow you to connect electric locks (2), pulse switches, or any other control mechanisms via dry contact. On the right, there is also a POE-compatible RJ45 port.\n\nFinally, on the side, there is a micro SD card compartment for recording motion captures and videos locally, like on an IP camera.\n\n\n\nFinally, since I own a Doorbird D202, I took a screenshot to show you the differences between the two. They’re not the same product at all, but one thing is certain: the video quality of the Hikvision DS-KV8X13 is significantly superior to the Doorbird.\n\n\n Note that the price of the Hikvision ds-KV8213 is a quarter of the price of a Doorbird D202. You can find it on AliExpress for around €120. While integration with Home Assistant isn’t as straightforward, it’s not insurmountable.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Intercom DS-KV8213 + Rfid\n By Hikvision\n Hikvision DS-KV8213 Two-Bell Doorphone with Badge\n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Aliexpress\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n The 720P video quality is far superior to the older D202 intercoms manufactured by Doorbird.\n\n\nDS-KH6350 Screen\n\nLet’s unbox the 7” screen included with the kit. I chose the DS-KH6350. I have no complaints. The packaging is neat, and the screen comes with:\n\n\n a wall mount\n instructions\n screws\n connection cables.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Screen DS-KH6350\n By Hikvision\n 7 inch hikvision ds-kh6350 screen\n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Aliexpress\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nRegarding connectivity, it can be powered by a standard RJ45 POE port or a 12V power supply. This screen can also be used to connect one or two electric locks for remote control.\n\nThe screen can also be connected to a Wi-Fi network.\n\n\n\nGood to know: Monitors can operate independently of the door entry system, and vice versa. For example, you could purchase a monitor and an IP camera to control access to a front door.\n\n\n\nNice quality screen, too bad it doesn’t run Android so you can display Home Assistant or any other apps.\n\nIf you want a Hikvision Android compatible screen, there’s a 10” one the DS-KH9510, seul défaut sa faible résolution de 1024x600\n\n&lt;img class=\"pictinpost lazyload\" src=\"https://haade.fr/assets/images/generated/posts/161/capture-station-accueil-ds-kh6350-hikvision-240-37916ed6f.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the DS-KH6350 docking station by Hikvision--img width=\"940\" height=\"529\"\"&gt;\n\nThe negative point of the ds-kh6350 screens, apart from a proprietary integration, is the resolution which is capped at 1024x600px, I would have liked a resolution of 1280x800px, but on this type of product it remains a detail.\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Complet Kit Intercom DS-KV8113\n By Hikvision\n Complete Hikvision DS-KV8X13 intercom kit with screen, NFC badge and PoE switch\n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Aliexpress\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nConnection method\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Badge RFID 13.56Mhz\n By Rfid\n Hikvision compatible 13.56Mhz RFID badge\n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Aliexpress\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nThere are two methods to integrate the Hikvision intercom DS-KV8X13. The first method is to connect a DS-KH6350 screen to the network as well as the doorphone. Then, simply follow the initial installation steps on the screen. Nothing complicated.\n\nThe second method, if you ordered a standalone doorphone so you can easily control it from your smartphone or via the Home Assistant app, will require you to use the official Hik-Connect app to install it on your network.\n\nBelow, I’ll explain the installation method using the Hik-Connect app in more detail.\n\nWith screen (easiest control)\n\nSince I didn’t have an RJ45 socket near my office, I didn’t perform this procedure for the video tutorial. However, there are many videos circulating on the web showing how to do this. Below I have attached an installation video, it is not in French but it will do the trick.\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Portier DS-KV8113 + Rfid\n By Hikvision\n Hikvision DS-KV8113 Doorbell with Badge\n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Aliexpress\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nWith the Hikvision app (Wi-Fi)\n\nFirst step: create a Hik-connect account and download the smartphone app.\n\nHik-connect app\n\nHik-connect is the app that will allow you to access your door entry system via the web; it’s a cloud service with a Chinese server.\nYou can either choose to use the web app https://hik-connect.com or via your smartphone by installing the official application.\n\nYou don’t have to use this app if you integrate the DS-KV8X13 intercom into Home Assistant.\n\n\n However, if you use the screenless door entry system, you’ll need to use this app to configure the activation.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n More informations on Qrcode\n This QRcode allows you to Download the Hik-connect app directly for Android or Apple you have the choice between scanning this QRcode from your smartphone or clicking directly on the link below.\n \n Hik-connect applications for Smartphone\n \n\n\nOnce set up, the initial step is to connect your intercom to your private Wi-Fi network. Even if it’s connected via POE during this process, Hik-Connect favors the Wi-Fi network.\n\nDuring the product registration steps, I recommend clicking on manually add a device. Then, simply enter the serial number, which you can find directly on the back of the intercom.\n\nFinally, power on the intercom, wait a few seconds for an alarm to sound. Then, to activate access point mode, simply press and hold the top doorbell for 10 seconds and click on access point enabled.\n\n\n\nIn the following steps, you will need to enter:\n\n\n Your Wi-Fi network password and click Next\n A username and password for the device\n\n\n\n\nThe network will configure itself automatically, and there you have it, the doorman is connected to the home network and fully configurable, but not unfortunately directly in the hik-connect application.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the hik-connect application doesn’t allow you to know or find the IP address of the doorman. To do this, you’ll unfortunately have to search directly in your box’s settings, for example. It’s quite easy to identify.\n\n\n\nOnce you have access to the terminal’s hardware configuration, you can change the network connection method by switching from Wi-Fi to RJ45. To do this, follow these steps:\n\n\n Connect to the server (IP address)\n Go to Network &gt; Basic Settings\n Enable DHCP under TCP/IP and save (this will force and generate a dynamic IP address)\n Then disable DHCP and save (if you want a static IP address)\n Go to the Wi-Fi tab and uncheck the box, then save\n Restart the gateway (System &gt; Maintenance tab).\n\n\nI’ve illustrated the procedure in an animated GIF below.\n\n\n\nFor the rest of the details of the configuration watch the video that I specially made for the occasion, it is not the best but it is more detailed.\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nControl via external services\n\nThe Hikvision DS-KV8x13 intercom and the DS-KH6350 monitor are fully controllable via Home Assistant. For camera control, I chose to integrate it into the free Frigate video controller. You’ll see this later in this tutorial. PergolaFabio offers an alternative for connecting video control directly to Home Assistant without using an external NVR.\n\nTo follow this integration, you will need:\n\n\n Home Assistant OS\n Frigate\n Mosquitto MQTT\n Install HACS\n Install Frigate and advanced-card-camera via HACS\n Install the Hikvision add-on via PergolaFabio\n\n\nAnd below is the final result of the integration\n\n\n\nHome Assistant Integration\n\nFirst of all, you’ll need to install the mqtt (mosquitto) add-on module. If you’ve never done so before, you can easily find a suitable tutorial online.\n\nFind the full installation method on the module’s GitHub.\n\nThen you need to integrate the device’s functions into home-assistant using the pergolaFabio add-on, I let you click on this link to follow the installation steps of the repository and add-on.\n\n\n\nOnce installed, you’ll need to modify the configuration\n\nTo do this, it’s easy. Go to the module’s configuration tab:\n\nIn the Doorbells column, you must:\n\n\n Set the entity name\n The doorbell’s IP address DS-KV8X13\n The doorbell’s username and password\n\n\nYou can configure multiple entities see the module’s instructions\n\nin the mqtt: column\n\n\n the IP address of the MQTT server\n the port (1883 by default)\n SSL activation, if applicable\n the mqtt username\n the mqtt password\n\n\n\n Finally, start the module\n\n\nIf everything went well, you will have access to both modules and all the necessary functions\n\n\n\n\n\nPS: For the screen, you can activate additional functions by activating scenes in the module.\n\nYou can now use the door entry system or the screen to:\n\n\n reject or hang up calls\n mute/unmute the audio output\n activate the dry contact outputs\n reboot\n answer the call\n view the call status\n etc.\n\n\n\n\nFrigate Integration\n\nTo control the camera stream, I use the Frigate NVR . I won’t go over its features. You’ll find all the information on the official website. It’s important to remember that this NVR is free and can be used in an external Docker, making it potentially compatible with all open-source assistants on the market, such as Openhab, Jeedom, etc.\n\n\n Frigate is fully compatible and can be integrated into Home Assistant.\n\n\nI use the Frigate link module, available in the HACS directory. This will bring up all the cameras configured in Frigate in the Home Assistant instance.\n\nBelow is the code for integrating the camera into Frigate.\n\nOne of the features of the Hikvision camera that makes it a bit more complex to configure is its Isapi function. Fortunately this function has been supported by the go2rtc manager since 2022 and can therefore be configured in frigate.\n\ngo2rtc:\n streams:\n interphone:\n - &quot;ffmpeg:rtsp://admin:aaa@192.168.x.x/Streaming/Channels/101/#async#input=rtsp/udp#video=copy#audio=aac#audio=opus#hardware=cuda&quot;\n - isapi://admin:aaa@192.168.x.x:80/\ncameras:\n interphone:\n enabled: true\n audio: \n enabled: true\n min_volume: 100\n ffmpeg:\n output_args:\n record: preset-record-generic-audio-copy\n inputs:\n - path: rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/interphone?video&amp;audio\n input_args: preset-rtsp-restream\n roles:\n - record\n - audio\n - detect\n\nhttps://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/discussions/12501\n\n\n Once this code is integrated, the camera will go back to frigate\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Portier DS-KV8113 + Rfid\n By Hikvision\n Hikvision DS-KV8113 Doorbell with Badge\n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Aliexpress\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nAdvanced Camera Custom Card\n\nThanks to the advanced camera card available in the HACS directory, you can easily integrate the Hikvision door entry camera DS-KV8X13 into Home Assistant.\n\n\n GO2RTC compatible\n Frigate compatible\n ISAPI compatible\n\n\n\n\nBelow is the code used to display the camera in Lovelace with the custom advanced camera card\n\ntype: custom:advanced-camera-card\ncameras:\n - camera_entity: camera.intercom\nmenu:\n style: outside\n position: bottom\n buttons:\n microphone:\n enabled: true\n type: toggle\n screenshot:\n enabled: false\n download:\n enabled: false\n fullscreen:\n enabled: false\n snapshots:\n enabled: false\n timeline:\n enabled: false\n media_player:\n enabled: false\n clips:\n enabled: false\n live:\n enabled: false\n cameras:\n enabled: false\n iris:\n enabled: false\n camera_ui:\n enabled: false\nlive:\n microphone:\n always_connected: true\n mute_after_microphone_mute_seconds: 90\n auto_mute: []\n auto_unmute: []\n controls:\n builtin: true\n title:\n mode: none\n layout:\n fit: fill\nelements:\n - type: custom:advanced-camera-card-menu-icon\n icon: mdi:volume-high\n tap_action:\n - action: custom:advanced-camera-card-action\n advanced_camera_card_action: unmute\n - type: custom:advanced-camera-card-menu-icon\n icon: mdi:volume-off\n tap_action:\n - action: custom:advanced-camera-card-action\n advanced_camera_card_action: mute\n - type: custom:advanced-camera-card-menu-icon\n icon: mdi:phone\n tap_action:\n - action: call-service\n service: button.press\n data:\n entity_id: button.interphone_answer_call\n - action: call-service\n service: button.press\n data:\n entity_id: button.interphone_hangup_call\n - action: custom:advanced-camera-card-action\n advanced_camera_card_action: sleep\n duration:\n ms: 200\n - action: custom:advanced-camera-card-action\n advanced_camera_card_action: unmute\n - action: custom:advanced-camera-card-action\n advanced_camera_card_action: microphone_unmute\n - type: custom:advanced-camera-card-menu-icon\n icon: mdi:phone-hangup\n tap_action:\n - action: custom:advanced-camera-card-action\n advanced_camera_card_action: microphone_disconnect\n - action: custom:advanced-camera-card-action\n advanced_camera_card_action: mute\n - action: call-service\n service: text.set_value\n data:\n entity_id: text.interphone_isapi_request\n value: PUT /ISAPI/System/TwoWayAudio/channels/1/close\n - type: custom:advanced-camera-card-menu-icon\n icon: mdi:door-open\n tap_action:\n - action: call-service\n service: switch.turn_on\n data:\n entity_id: switch.interphone_door_relay_0\ndimensions:\n aspect_ratio_mode: static\n aspect_ratio: &quot;4:3&quot;\nstatus_bar:\n style: none\nprofiles: []\ncameras_global:\n dimensions:\n layout:\n fit: fill\n\nhttps://github.com/pergolafabio/Hikvision-Addons/\n\nConclusion\n\nHikvision is a very well-made Chinese manufacturer, including the Hikvision intercom DS-KV8X13. In addition to its low price compared to the competition, it offers many undeniable advantages in home automation. It’s not perfect, but it will do the job perfectly in most cases.
