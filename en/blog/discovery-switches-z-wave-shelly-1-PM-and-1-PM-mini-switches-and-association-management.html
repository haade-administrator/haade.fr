Are they up to par? for the price and especially what options are offered for these z-wave modules?\n\n \n \n \n \n Warning\n Deal to do, from July 24 to 29, 2024 For her Birthday, Shelly is offering an unbeatable deal for 1 Z-wave module purchased on their site, 1 module free\n \n 1 z-wave module purchased = 1 module free\n \n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n An Open source box (jeedom, Home Assistant) with ZwaveJS UI server\n Or simply a ZwaveJS UI server\n a key z-wave 800 of the Zooz ZST39 type\n a Shelly Wave 1PM or 1PM Mini switch\n\n\n \n \n \n \n Info\n Haade.fr is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\n \n\n\nZooz key firmware update procedure\n\nAfter integrating the module into your system it will be important to update the Z-wave modules including the Z-wave key. Remember that the z-wave 800 is recent, the micromodules too, so it is important to do these updates, especially for the Zooz key because the SDK z-wave 7.19.3 is having issues.\n\n \n \n \n \n Info\n All Zooz and Shelly Wave modules are compatible with Z-waveJS and Z-waveJS UI integrations, therefore compatible with Home Assistant, Jeedom, etc.\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n ZOOZ - Z-WAVE+ 800 USB CONTROLLER\n By Zooz\n All new Z-Wave 800 series long range radio USB key: incredible signal, ultra secure and fast network!\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now\n \n \n\n\n\nRegarding Zooz ZST39 Key: Do NOT perform NVM backup from Z-Wave 500 Series or 700 Series keys for this device. This feature is currently supported for devices with firmware 1.30 or higher, otherwise if you are using 1.20 or lower, NVM will block the product. Please read this article before attempting a firmware update on your Z-Wave key. If you purchased your Z-Wave key in June 2024 or later, it should have the latest version, so do not attempt an update.\n\nZooz Firmware Set Page\nFirmware 1.3 Zooz ZST39 EU\n\nIn ZwaveJS\n\nUpdating to the latest Zooz firmware can be done in the ZwaveJS integration but not in the Z-waveJS UI library. I made an animated gif showing this update in ZwaveJS.\n\n\n\nZ-waveJS\n\nZ-wave JS is a z-wave integration that allows you to fully control the z-wave protocol in an opensource wizard.\nThe z-waveJS plugin is available on most opensource infrastructures on the market:\nThe Jeedom module directly integrates ZwaveJS and the Z-waveJS UI library\nJeedom\n\nIn Home Assistant only z-waveJS will appear as a controller as a device, you will need to install the z-waveJS UI add-on if you want to install the full library (highly recommended).\nHome Assistant\n\nIn ZwaveJS UI\n\nZ-waveJS UI\n\nNote: Z-wave JS UI is a complete z-wave library that works with the Z-waveJS module, in no case will it allow you to control the protocol for this you will have to install in parallel the z-waveJS module (depending on your opensource system).\n\nInclusion of Z-wave 800 modules\n\nTraditionally\n\nModules can be included in two different ways. The first is the oldest, when the time comes, you just have to click on the S inclusion button available on all modules.\n\nFor shelly:\n\n Press the button for 1 second\n Press for 2 seconds until the blue light remains fixed\n Press for 2 seconds until the blue button flashes\n\n\nAnd there you will switch to inclusion/exclusion mode.\n\nThe second solution is to include the shelly wave via the physical switch connected to the module after a wall installation. Find the manipulation in the instructions provided with the module which is well done.\n\nThe z-wave 800 modules are equipped with optimum security of type S2, they can be included in traditional ways (by inclusion button specific to the module or via a switch connected to the modules) but in addition it will be necessary to put a pin key during the inclusion process available on the module with the qrcode and the additional label.\n\n\n So when you are used to integrating z-wave modules you will not find the manipulation very complicated but this is not the case for novices.\n\n\nWith Smartstart (New)\n\nIt is for this purpose that the z-wave alliance has created Smartstart. Smartstart was created to greatly simplify the integration of a z-wave 800 module and not scare away future owners of z-wave modules.\n\n\n\nUsing your smartphone and your z-wave manager, you can integrate a module by scanning the qrcode provided with the module. Then you will simply have to power the module and it will be directly included in S2 security in your network.\n\n\n It couldn’t be simpler.\n\n\n\n\nShelly Wave 1 PM\n\nThe Shelly wave 1 PM is in the standard dimensions of the Shelly Plus series, the displayed price is less than 30€\n\n\n This is very good news for a Z-wave 800 compatible module\n\n\nNo worries when unpacking Negative, everything is well done you will find inside:\n\n The wave 1 PM module\n the complete user manual\n The sticker with S2 security Pin code\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Wave 1 PM\n By Shelly\n Monitor and measure the power consumption of a wide range of home appliances and office equipment (lights, power lines, security systems, heaters, water heaters, etc.) from anywhere.\n \n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Domadoo\n \n \n \n Buy Now out of Amazon\n \n \n \n\n\nA few additional photos of the Shelly Wave 1 PM, you will be able to see the size as well as the sticker located on the side containing all the security information in order to be able to integrate it using the PIN code into your favorite assistant.\n\n\n\nUser manuals\n\nOnline manual Shelly Wave 1 PM\n\nUser guide V3 shelly wave 1 PM\n\nTechnical data\n\n\n \n \n Power supply\n 110-240 V AC / 24–30 V DC\n \n \n Power consumption\n &lt; 0.3 W\n \n \n Electricity meter (W)\n Yes\n \n \n AC switching voltage max\n 240 V\n \n \n AC switching current max\n 16 A\n \n \n DC switching voltage max\n 30 V\n \n \n DC switching current max\n 10 A\n \n \n Output power max\n 2400 W\n \n \n Overheating protection\n Yes\n \n \n Overload protection\n Yes\n \n \n Range\n Up to 40 m indoors (131 ft) (depending on local conditions)\n \n \n Z-Wave™ repeater\n Yes\n \n \n CPU\n Z-Wave™ S800\n \n \n Frequency bands\n Z-Wave™ 868.4 MHz - 865.2 MHz - 869.0 MHz - 921.4 MHz - 908.4 MHz - 916 MHz - 919.8 MHz - 922.5 MHz - 919.7-921.7-923.7 MHz - 868.1 MHz - 920.9 MHz\n \n \n Maximum radio power\n transmitted in frequency band(s) &lt; 25 mW\n \n \n Dimensions\n 37 x 42 x 16 mm ±0.5 mm / 1.46 x 1.65 x 0.63 in ±0.02 in\n \n \n Weight\n 27 g / 0.95 oz.\n \n \n Mounting\n Electrical panel, flush-mounting box\n \n \n Maximum tightening\n of electrical terminals 0.4 Nm / 3.5 lbin\n \n \n Cable diameter\n 0.5 to 1.5 mm² / 20 to 16 AWG\n \n \n Cable stripped length\n 5 to 6 mm / 0.20 to 0.24 in\n \n \n Housing material\n Plastic\n \n \n Color\n Red\n \n \n Ambient temperature\n -20 °C to 40 °C / -5 °F to 105 °F\n \n \n Humidity\n 30 % to 70 %\n \n \n Maximum altitude\n 2000 m / 6562 ft\n \n \n\n\nFirmware update\n\nUnlike the key, updating a z-wave module can be done either in z-waveJS as for the z-wave controller or in Z-waveJU UI and as a picture is worth a thousand words, I took below a screenshot in animated Gif format, follow the process and your module will be updated.\n\n\n\nShelly wave 1 PM Firmware\n\nAt the time of writing this article the latest firmware update is version 11.10 dated [2024-03-28] with the following fixes:\n\n\n Fixed device not working with DC power\n Fixed OTA signaling\n Optimized temperature conversion table\n Other minor improvements\n\n\nShelly Wave 1 PM firmware recovery\n\nDirect download links of Firmware .gbl 11.10 EU version\n\nExtra Bonus\n\nAs this is a PLUS series, you can integrate it with the Shelly WS1 kit which is nothing more than a switch compatible with various modules of the brand but is not compatible for the Mini versions.\n\n\n\nYou will need to make a small cut in the plus module, to be able to integrate the Z-wave antenna.\n\n\n Nothing too complicated.\n\n\nInstallation of the Shelly Z-wave 1 PM\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nShelly Wave 1 PM Mini\n\nThe packaging is identical to the Shelly wave 1 PM only the size of the micromodule differs, it is extremely small.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n Wave 1 PM Mini\n By Shelly\n The world's smallest Z-Wave smart switch for smart control.

Below I am repeating an update of the wave 1 PM mini but this time everything happens in the Z-waveJS UI library. It is different but not more complicated. So you will have all the solutions to update the firmwares in OTA of the Z-wave 800 modules.\n\n\n\nShelly wave 1 PM Mini Firmware\n\nAt the time of writing this article the latest firmware update is version 11.03 dated [2024-03-29] with the following fixes:\n\n\n optimized temperature conversion table\n other minor improvements\n\n\nShelly Wave 1 PM Mini firmware recovery\n\nDirect download links of Firmware .gbl 11.03 EU version\n\nInstalling the Shelly Z-wave 1 PM Mini\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nComparison Shelly wave 1 PM and 1 PM mini\n\nBelow are some screenshots of the Shelly wave 1 PM and 1 PM mini modules, the color is identical, the functions are more numerous for the wave 1 PM, but the internal functions are almost identical.\n\n\n\nMain functions and differences\n\nI have included some functions to compare, but if you want to have access to all the functions, you just have to compare the technical characteristics of the two modules included in this article.\n\n\n \n \n functions\n wave 1 PM\n wave 1 PM Mini\n \n \n \n \n Power\n 2400 W\n 2000 W\n \n \n AC 110/230V\n x\n x\n \n \n DC 24/30V\n x\n -\n \n \n Power measurement in W\n x\n x\n \n \n Overheating protection\n x\n x\n \n \n Overload protection\n x\n x\n \n \n Dimensions\n 37 x 42 x 16 mm\n 29 x 35 x 16 mm\n \n \n\n\nWiring diagrams\n\nBelow I have taken the wiring diagrams of the two Shelly wave 1 PM and 1 PM Mini micromodules, these are examples made behind a switch but you can adapt them to also put them behind a socket.\n\n\n Be careful with the output power of the sockets.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n Info\n Haade.fr is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.\n \n\n\nShelly module associations\n\nAs a reminder, associations in Z-wave are the equivalent of Bindings in Zigbee, they allow you to link commands between two modules as an automation could do in Home Assistant, but in case of system losses or disconnection of the adapter the modules will work autonomously between them.\n\nThe big advantage of Z-wave compared to Zigbee is the fact that the protocol is proprietary all the chips integrated in the modules are designed by the same manufacturer and suddenly all the z-wave modules from 400 to 800 are compatible with each other.\n\nShelly wave 1 PM and 1 PM Mini\n\n\n\nGroup 1:\nLifeline group reserved for association with the coordinator\n\n INDICATOR_REPORT: LED status\n DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY_NOTIFICATION: triggered on request\n SWITCH_BINARY_REPORT: report of change of status of output O (O1)\n NOTIFICATION_REPORT: triggered on overheating\n METER_REPORT: triggered by the power consumption of the load (according to the setting of parameters no. 36 to 43)\n\n\nGroup 2:\n\n Allowed nodes: 9\n It is assigned to the switch connected to the SW (SW1) terminal (uses the Basic command class).\nTriggered by SW (SW1). The device sends according to the state of the SW (SW1) (switch or pushbutton) the BASIC_SET ON or BASIC_SET OFF command to the associated device. This command is reflected in the output of the associated device. Supports the following command classes:\n BASIC_SET: Set the On/Off state on the associated device\n\n\nThis is the association to use to group two simple ON/Off switches\n\nGroup 3:\n\n Allowed nodes: 9\n It is assigned to the switch connected to the SW (SW1) terminal (uses the multi-level start/stop command class).\nTriggered by SW (SW1).\n The device sends according to the state of the SW (SW1) (switch or pushbutton) the command SWITCH MULTILEVEL START LEVEL CHANGE or SWITCH MULTILEVEL STOP LEVEL CHANGE to the associated device.\n\n\nFunctional for dimmable lights for example.\n\nSupports the following command classes:\n\n SWITCH MULTILEVEL START LEVEL CHANGE: initiate a transition to a new level\n SWITCH MULTILEVEL STOP LEVEL CHANGE: stop a transition in progress\n\n\nConclusion\n\nHere is a first article presenting the Shelly Z-wave modules and I must say that it is a success on all points especially on the price side which have dropped significantly. These Z-wave 800 modules are well thought out, the integration is perfect be careful the z-wave needs neutral to work but apart from that I find that this protocol is more stable compared to zigbee. And the functions are more numerous compared to a similar Zigbee module.\n\n\n Do not hesitate to invest in these Shelly wave 1 PM or 1 PM mini modules, no doubt, they will satisfy you.\n\n",

they allow you to link commands between two modules as an automation could do in Home Assistant, but in case of system losses or disconnection of the adapter the modules will work autonomously between them.</p><p><strong>The big advantage of Z-wave</strong> compared to Zigbee is the fact that the protocol is proprietary all the chips integrated in the modules are designed by the same manufacturer

These Z-wave 800 modules are well thought out, the integration is perfect <strong>be careful the z-wave needs neutral to work</strong> but apart from that I find that this protocol is more stable compared to zigbee.
