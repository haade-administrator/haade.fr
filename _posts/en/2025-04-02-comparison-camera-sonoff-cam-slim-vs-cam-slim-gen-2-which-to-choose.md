Today, let's compare the two currently available Sonoff cameras for less than €30 from all our affiliated retailers. I'd like to thank Domadoo and Itead for providing me with this equipment.

## Sonoff Cam Slim Gen 1

{% include product-embed.html image="sonoff-camera-de-securite-intelligente-wi-fi-cam-slim.png" title="Sonoff Cam Slim Camera FHD" brand="Sonoff" description="Sonoff Cam Slim small wifi camera" iteadlink="sonoff-cam-slim-wi-fi-smart-security-camera" domlink="peripheriques/6334-sonoff-camera-de-securite-intelligente-wi-fi-cam-slim.html" affiliate="_ooQApu9" amazlink="4iTeqye" %}

The Slim FHD camera is the brand's first camera. It works with Wi-Fi.

> Both cameras also work with Wi-Fi.

**The mount is well made**, rotating 360°. This mount is quite heavy and easily weighs down the camera.

The Gen 2 Slim Cam differs from the Slim Cam thanks to its **intelligent detection** of human presence. In case of detection, a notification will be sent. This is a plus but not mandatory. Because if you don't use the official app, but an NVR manager like Frigate, it already manages AI detections for all types of cameras.

## Differences

Despite **similar dimensions**, the cases are quite different. Note that the Slim Cam's mount is larger but more practical.

Regarding the most significant **physical differences**, the mount is in the Slim Cam. The **Slim Cam is round**, while the **Gen 2 is square**.

Regarding the image, the Sonoff Cam Slim has a **130° wide angle** which is interesting for small rooms with little space. The image from it **is less colorful/contrasted** than the Gen 2.

## the Ewelink app

Sonoff cameras are compatible with the **Ewelink** app, but they also work with "OK Google" and "Alexa." ***Plus, the RTSP mode opens these cameras to many other systems.***

Well, like the rest of the Wifi range, if you want to use this product you will need to download the Ewelink application available on [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coolkit&hl=fr&gl=US){: target="_blank"} and [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/ewelink-smart-home/id1035163158){: target="_blank"}.

{% include qrlink.html qrlink="https://sonoff.tech/ewelink/" text="download the Ewelink app directly for Android or Apple" realtextlink="App Ewelink for Smartphone" %}

**To begin, pair the Slim Cam using:**

- A sound command to configure the network's Wi-Fi.
- You can also manually connect to the camera's Wi-Fi to find it in the Ewelink app and configure it.

**This is the old pairing method**.

Pairing the **Slim Cam Gen 2** is done using a QR code, which is much simpler.

> The Ewelink camera management interface is intuitive and works perfectly, as I've already discussed in various articles. Ewelink is a Sonoff product, and the app is very well designed.

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/cam-slim-ewelink-sonoff-caracteristique.png --alt Specific feature of Sonoff Cam Slim wifi camera in Ewelink --img width="640" height="1422" %}

**The functions are numerous and varied, you can:**

- Update the firmware
- Change the name
- Share the camera
- Create **smart scenes**
- Turn the blue LED on or off (the Gen 2 will be completely discreet at night)
- Store in the cloud
- Set up motion detection (enable/disable, type, **create zones (Gen 2 only)**, adjust sensitivity, duration, enable push notifications)
- Set up local recording on SD card
- Rotate the image
- More settings (adjust sound, microphone volume, **sleep time (Gen 2)**, set RTSP protocol, set privacy zones (Gen 2)**, enable watermark, set date and time (Cam-Slim)** and reboot the system)
- Set up Wi-Fi
- Enable night vision (auto, on, off)
- Enable the alarm

Below are **4 screenshots for RTSP setup** (important features available for both cameras).
You can even **generate a handy RTSP link to find the exact address** of the connection generated based on your local address and password.

## Which One to Choose?

The features of both cameras are relatively similar. **The image quality is identical** (the Gen 2 version) has higher contrast**.
The dimensions are relatively similar.
Both are RTSP compatible.

- If you're interested in a **wide-angle** camera, then the Slim Cam is for you.
- **If support and stability** are important, then the Slim Cam is for you.
- If infrared LEDs don't bother you, the Slim Cam is for you.

If you're interested in a camera that captures **human detection**, then the Gen 2 is for you.
If you want a camera that's **ultra discreet at night**, then the Gen 2 is for you.
If you need to **set up active zones** in Ewelink, then the Gen 2 is for you.

If you want to put your **camera into hibernation** then the Gen 2 is for you.

## Conclusion

Sonoff currently offers two cameras: the [FHD Slim Cam](https://www.domadoo.fr/fr/peripheriques/6334-sonoff-camera-de-securite-intelligente-wi-fi-cam-slim.html?domid=39){: target="_blank"} and the [cam Slim Gen2](https://www.domadoo.fr/fr/black-friday-domotique/7475-sonoff-camera-de-securite-intelligente-wi-fi.html?domid=39){: target="_blank"}. **These two cameras are high-quality**, and the integration with the **Ewelink environment is perfect** and very comprehensive. If you want to secure the interior of your home, then these two cameras are for you. I still have a **preference for the Slim Gen 2 Cam**.

> In short, these two cameras are **sold for around €30**, and for the price, you'll be completely won over.
