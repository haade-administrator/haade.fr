Following the creation of the **Shelly wall switch**, compatible with their micromodules, **Sonoff is following suit in this market and creating the Fusion range**, switch boxes compatible with the range's micromodules, closely resembling the **design of Siemens switches** widely available on the market.

> **But Sonoff doesn't stop there** and offers **DIY solutions through 3D printing**.

Below is a screenshot of the Shelly switches, pioneers in this field, especially with the Zigbee protocol. The Shelly modules are well-designed; however, the all-plastic construction **looks a bit cheap**.

## Let's start with the Fusion E1GS/SL range

Let's not waste time on the introduction, as the range expands rapidly.

The **Fusion E1GS** range is designed to integrate the **ZBMINIR2, MINIR4, and MINIR4M** models, which are three mini-switches, each operating under a different protocol: **Zigbee, Wi-Fi, and Matter**. Sonoff thus covers all protocols for integrating switches.

{% include product-embed.html image="MINIR4.png" title="MINIR4 Wifi" brand="Sonoff" description="The SONOFF WIFI MINIR4 micro-switch module offers the possibility to control lighting or electrical devices in your home from anywhere in the world, from your Smartphone." domlink="peripheriques/6600-sonoff-module-commutateur-connecte-wi-fi-10a-minir4.html" iteadlink="sonoff-mini-extreme-wi-fi-smart-switch-matter-enabled" sonofftech="products/sonoff-mini-extreme-wi-fi-smart-switch-matter-enabled" %}

**Thanks to the E1GS switch** you can now control your switches via Wi-Fi or with the Matter protocol.

Compatible with Matter, it works with Alexa, Google Home, HomeKit, and SmartThings. Enjoy the detachable relay, LAN control, and integration with SONOFF sensors and accessories for flexible, secure, and always-connected home automation." domlink="produits-de-domotique/8413-sonoff-module-onoff-matter-interrupteur-orb-mw1.html" sonofftech="sonoff-matter-over-wifi-smart-wall-switch-orb-mw1" %}

And even compatible with the Zigbee version with Neutral

{% include product-embed.html image="ZBMINIR2.png" title="ZBMINIR2 Zigbee" brand="Sonoff" description="The Sonoff ZBMINIR2 Zigbee switch module offers the ability to control a device/light in your home and repeat the Zigbee signal." iteadlink="sonoff-zbminil2-extreme-zigbee-smart-switch-no-neutral-required" domlink="peripheriques/6619-sonoff-commutateur-intelligent-sans-neutre-zigbee-30-zbminil2.html"  affiliate="_DkilCPV" sonofftech="sonoff-smart-roller-shutter-switch-mini-rbs" %}

The switch comes as a single unit; you can find kits with micro-modules on various websites like Domadoo and Sonoff.

As for the E1GSL version, it's specifically designed for the ZBMINIL2, which, as a reminder, is the mini module without a neutral wire that works with the Zigbee protocol.

{% include product-embed.html image="ZBMINIL2.png" title="ZBMINIL2 Extrême Zigbee + Switch" brand="Sonoff" description="Transform your ordinary lights into smart lights with the SONOFF ZBMINIL2-E. This Zigbee module requires no neutral wiring and offers two-way control, timers, and smart scenes. It's compatible with Alexa, Google Home, Jeedom, Home Assistant, and Zigbee2MQTT. Installation is simple thanks to its ergonomic E1GSL housing and ultra-slim design." domlink="produits-de-domotique/8412-sonoff-module-zigbee-sans-neutre-interrupteur-zbminil2-e.html" sonofftech="sonoff-zigbee-smart-wall-switch-no-neutral-required-orb-zbw1l" %}

## Roller Shutter Switches

Sonoff not only offers switch boxes for switch modules, but also for roller shutters; even better, you can now also find the Zigbee-compatible micro-module.

A **few details** about the Sonoff roller shutter switch compatible with Zigbee or Matter.

Matter roller shutter version

{% include product-embed.html image="MINI-RBS.png" title="Matter Module Roller Shutter + Switch" brand="Sonoff" description="Control your roller shutters remotely with the SONOFF ORB-RBS switch compatible with Matter, WiFi and ESP32, for precise, programmable and connected adjustment." domlink="produits-de-domotique/8372-sonoff-interrupteur-module-volet-roulant-wifi-matter-orb-rbs.html" sonofftech="sonoff-matter-over-wifi-smart-roller-shutter-wall-switch-orb-rbs" %}

Big news now [available in Zigbee thanks to the Mini-ZBRBS](products/sonoff-zigbee-smart-roller-shutter-switch-mini-zbrbs){: target="_blank"} the long-awaited micro-module for shutters.

## Wall Plates for 2 or 3 Switches

Don't worry, you can easily buy the switches without the modules, so you can customize them with the 2 or 3 module cover plate. Let's move on to the plates/frames for the Fusion switches in the range. Like other brands, these plates allow you to aesthetically integrate two or three switches.

> On the two-switch plate you can even use **a double EU recessed box**.

A very interesting feature is that Sonoff offers 3D printable models to [make these plates compatible with other products of the brand](https://makerworld.com/fr/collections/7598269-fusion-series-accessories?ref=haadeone&sub_id=affiliate){:target="_blank"}, And frankly, that's both super cool and impressive of the Sonoff brand. Okay, you need to have a printer, it's better, but some sites allow you to print online, like PCBway, JLPcb, or...d'autres encore.

## 3D Printing Solutions for Sonoff Fusion

In addition to offering micromodules compatible with Fusion switches, making everything work together, Sonoff offers additional 3D-printable accessories to make other Sonoff products compatible with the switches. See for yourself for more details 😋.

Thanks to these models available on [Makerworld.com](https://makerworld.com/fr/collections/7598269-fusion-series-accessories?ref=haadeone&sub_id=affiliate){:target="_blank"} You can integrate an SNZB-01/02/03P module next to your switches and make a switch even smarter.

## Conclusion

Sonoff m'impressionnera toujours mais là, la barre est mise à l'innovation, ils ne cessent de créer de nouveaux produit toujours plus poussés de très bonne facture et bien pensé. 
> Franchement selon moi c'est la marque de l'année. 
La gamme Fusion est super sympa, de proposer des impressions 3d pour pousser encore plus loin la créativité me plait énormément
**Cependant une plaque de fixation en acier aurait fait une grande différence.**
