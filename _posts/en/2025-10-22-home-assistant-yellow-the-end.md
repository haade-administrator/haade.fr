**Damn! Nabu Casa has decided to stop producing** the manufacturer's most versatile box, the Yellow. Indeed, according to the latest post on the official blog, sales of the Yellow are declining! **Whew! Good news**: hardware compatibility updates will continue!

If you're not familiar with this box, [an article about the Yellow has been written on this blog]({% post_url /en/2024-11-21-test-of-homebox-home-assistant-jaune-zigbee-3-zwave-8-ssd-500go %}).

In 2021, Nabu Casa announced the Home Assistant Yellow (originally called Amber). It featured unique features, including a built-in Zigbee or Thread adapter, optional PoE power, and comprehensive scalability. Using the Raspberry Pi Compute Module platform, including GPIOs and an NVMe slot, it offered numerous upgrade options (including the ability to upgrade from CM4 to CM5, which was a real time saver).


Not everything went smoothly with the Home Assistant Yellow. It was launched during the Pi shortage. This complicated things for a while, but the situation eventually stabilized. At the end of 2023, Nabu Casa launched the Home Assistant Green, which became the easiest way to get started with Home Assistant. This new product led the team to discontinue the sale of Home Assistant Yellows that came with a pre-installed CM4 (called Home Assistant Yellow Standard).

## Why Did We Discontinue This Box

The **Home Assistant Green**{: ​​.green} continues to record strong sales, while the **Home Assistant Yellow**{: .yellow} is experiencing a natural slowdown, as is often the case after a product's two-year lifespan. This month, **production finally reached a point where it was no longer justified**, which ultimately forced us, the team, to discontinue the **Yellow**{: .yellow} Home Assistant.

## Where can we still get supplies?

> Well, after scouring all the European websites, I didn't even have time to finish writing this article before the Hoime Assistant Yellow sold out.

However, if you want to upgrade to the Nabu Casa box, there is always the Green

I had also **written at the time** an article on [Home Assistant Green]({% post_url /en/2023-09-18-new-box-home-assistant-green-anniversary-10-years %})

## What about software support?

As long as Home Assistant can be used on the Yellow model, the Home Assistant team will continue to offer updates.
A concrete demonstration of this commitment is the Home Assistant Blue, "the first Nabu casa box." Its production ended in 2022, but it continues to receive new versions of Home Assistant, ***a trend that doesn't seem likely to change!***

> We continue to simplify and improve the efficiency of Home Assistant, because our goal is for you to be able to use it on your current hardware.

## And what do you think?

It's a shame, because the strong point of this Home Assistant Yellow was its scalability (thanks in particular to support for Raspberry Pi compute CM4 or CM5). But that's not all. The Yellow had GPIOs where you could [add a Z-Wave antenna, notably from Zooz](https://www.domadoo.fr/en/smart-home-hub/7647-zooz-z-wave-800-series-gpio-module-zac93-0853478006933.html?domid=39){: target="blank"}. However, Nabu Casa has announced that it is considering a new, evolving box [feel free to share your views, like others on their sites](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/10/15/yellow-end-of-life/){: target="blank"}.
